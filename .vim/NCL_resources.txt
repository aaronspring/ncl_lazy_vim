amDataXF When amTrackData is True, amDataXF sets the X coordinate of the annotation item's base location. Default: 0.0 
amDataYF When amTrackData is True, amDataYF sets the Y coordinate of the annotation item's base location. Default: 0.0 
amJust This resource of type NhlTJustification, after constraint to an appropriate value based on amSide, sets the justification point of the annotation with respect to its base location. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Note that amJust still has an effect when amTrackData is True. Normally, amJust is constrained based on the value of amSide. However, if amZone is 0 or 1, or amTrackData is True, the PlotManager does not constrain amJust. Note in addition that the position of the justification point is determined from the viewport of the annotation View object only. That is to say, while it is possible that View object's bounding box might be larger than its viewport, any extent outside the viewport is not considered when determining the justification point. This means that that there is the possibility of overlap if a View object has elements extending outside its own viewport along the edge closest to the PlotManager Plot viewport. Default: CenterCenter 
amOn This boolean resource specifies whether the base plot should draw the annotation View object along with the other objects comprising the plot. Default: True 
amOrthogonalPosF If amTrackData is False and amZone is not equal to one, amOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the annotation orthogonal to the current amSide and directed away from the center of the PlotManager viewport. If amZone is equal to one, the direction is from the viewport side specified by amSide toward the viewport center. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
amParallelPosF If amTrackData is False, amParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the annotation parallel to the current amSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
amResizeNotify If this boolean resource is True, the PlotManager sets the height and width of the annotation item whenever the size of the base plot's viewport changes. Height is adjusted based on the ratio of the new viewport height to the old height. Width is adjusted based on the ratio of the new viewport width to the old width. Default: False 
amSide If amTrackData is False, this resource of type NhlTPosition determines which of the zone's interior sides to use as a base for establishing the coordinate system within which the annotation is placed. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Its value determines the origin of the coordinate system and the direction of the positional resources, amParallelPosF and amOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of amJust appropriately. There are four settings, which behave as follows, unless amZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): NhlTOP     The PlotManager locates the annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. amOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. amParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. amJust is constrained to NhlBOTTOMRIGHT, NhlBOTTOMCENTER, or NhlBOTTOMLEFT.  NhlBOTTOM     The PlotManager locates the annotation relative to a line paralleling the bottom viewport boundary. amOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. amParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. amJust is constrained to NhlTOPRIGHT, NhlTOPCENTER, or NhlTOPLEFT.  NhlRIGHT     The PlotManager locates the annotation relative to a line paralleling the right viewport boundary. amOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. amParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. amJust is constrained to NhlTOPLEFT, NhlCENTERLEFT, or NhlBOTTOMLEFT.  NhlLEFT     The PlotManager locates the annotation item relative to a line paralleling the left viewport boundary. amOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. amParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. amJust is constrained to NhlTOPRIGHT, NhlCENTERRIGHT, or NhlBOTTOMRIGHT.  If amZone is set to 0, the PlotManager locates the annotation item relative to the viewport center. If amZone is 1, the annotation is located relative to the viewport boundary itself, and the direction of the amOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the amZone is either 0 or 1, amJust is not constrained, and amOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
amTrackData When amTrackData is set False, the PlotManager locates the annotation View object in NDC space using the PlotManager Location Control Model resources amZone, amSide, amParallelPosF, amOrthogonalPosF and amJust. If amTrackData is True, the annotation is positioned relative to the data coordinate space of the base plot. In this case, the PlotManager determines the base position of the annotation item from the values of the resources amDataXF and amDataYF. The resources amZone, amSide, amParallelPosF, and amOrthogonalPosF are ignored. However, the resource amJust still determines the justification point of the annotation with respect to its base location. Default: False 
amViewId You can use this resource to retrieve the id of the View object controlled by the AnnoManager. Note that this resource can be set only when the AnnoManager object is created. Default: <dynamic> 
amZone If amTrackData is False, amZone specifies the PlotManager zone assigned to the annotation. amZone is one of the resources you must set in order to control the location of the annotation in a manner consistent with the rules of the PlotManager Location Control Model. If amZone is set to 0, the annotation is located relative to the center of the PlotManager viewport; otherwise, it is located relative to one side of the zone's interior boundary, which is the bounding box of the previous zone. Default: 0 
appDefaultParent This resource is only True for one App object at a time. If it is True in a given App object, then that App object is the one that will be used as the parent of any objects created with the parentid argument of NhlCreate set to NhlDEFAULT_APP or 0. Default: <dynamic> This resource defaults to True for the First App object created, otherwise it is False. 
appFileSuffix This resource is used to specify a suffix for the Application specific resource files. It is useful to set this resource in the $(NCARG_USRRESFILE) and $(NCARG_SYSRESFILE), if an application programmer wants to provide more than one Application Specific Resource file. For example, if some of the end users do not have color monitors, then there could be two resource files. One appname.bw.res, and another appname.color.res. Then the appFileSuffix resource can be specified to indicate which Application specific resource file to use. Default: .res 
appResources This resource specifies an array of names. Each one of these names dynamically becomes a valid resource for the App object. This is a very useful feature for developers of multi-user applications because configuration parameters for the application can become resources to the App object. Then, users of the application can configure the application using the same resource files that they use to configure the HLU portion of the application. Default: NULL 
appSysDir This resource is used to indicate what directory the App object should look in for the System application specific resource file. Default: <dynamic> This resource defaults to the value of the $(NCARG_SYSAPPRES) environment variable. 
appUsrDir This resource is used to indicate what directory the App object should look in for the User's application specific resource file. Default: ./ (Current Working Directory) 
caCopyArrays This resource is used to determine if the CoordArrays object should make its own copy of the caXArray and caYArray data. If this resource is False, it is important for the programmer to keep the data around without modifying it. However; it is more efficient--if more dangerous--that way. Default: True 
caXArray This resource specifies the X values of the X/Y coordinate data. It is an array of X values. If it is a one-dimensional array, then it specifies a single vector of X values. If it is a two-dimensional array, then the caXCast resource is used to determine which dimension indicates the number of vectors, and which dimension indicates the number of elements within each vector. If the caXArray resource is not set, then all of the Y values set with the caYArray resource will be paired with their integer array index. For example, assuming caYCast is MultipleVectors and C syntax:
 (1, yarray[0][0]) (2, yarray[0][1]) (N, yarray[0][N-1]) If the caXArray resource is not set, then the caYArray resource must be set. Default: NULL 
caXCast This resource is used to tell the CoordArrays object how to interpret the caXArray resource. The three valid values are: SingleVector     The value SingleVector indicates that the caXArray provides the data for a single vector. This vector will be reused to match every vector specified by the caYArray. If the caXArray resource is set with a one-dimensional array, then the entire array will be used for the vector. If the caXArray resource is set with a two-dimensional array, then the vector will be made up from the values in the fastest-changing dimension. For example, in pseudo C array notation:
     floatxarray[0][0-(N-1)];     In pseudo Fortran  array notation:
     REALXARR(1-N,1)     Where N is the len gth of the given dimension. MultipleVectors     The value MultipleVectors indicates that if the caXArray resource is set with a one-dimensional array, then the entire array is used to specify a single vector that is not reused. If the caXArray resource is set with a two-dimensional array, then the caXArray has the array ordered such that the fastest-changing dimension contains the elements of each vector, and the other dimension contains the vectors. For example, in pseudo C array notation:
     floatxarray[NUM_VECTORS][NUM_ELEMENTS];     In pseudo Fortran a rray notation:
     REALXARR(NUM_ELEMENTS,NUM_VECTORS) Split Vectors     The value SplitVectors indicates that the caXArray has the array ordered such that the fastest-changing dimension contains the vectors, and the other dimension contains the elements. For example, in pseudo C array notation:
     floatxarray[NUM_ELEMENTS][NUM_VECT ORS];     In pseudo Fortran array notation:
     REALXARR(NU M_VECTORS,NUM_ELEMENTS) Default: <dynamic> If the caXArray resource is specified with a one-dimensional array or not at all, then the default value is SingleVector. Otherwise, the default value is MultipleVectors. NOTE: If the caXCast resource is set to SplitVectors, then the caXArray resource will need to be reordered and copied internally so it is not as efficient. 
caXMaxV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrays object the maximum value contained in the caXArray resource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrays object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
caXMinV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrays object the minimum value contained in the caXArray resource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrays object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
caXMissingV This resource indicates a missing value for the elements in the caXArray resource. When the HLU library is parsing the data in the caXArray elements, it will treat any element with this value as missing data. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: None 
caYArray This resource specifies the Y values of the X/Y coordinate data. It is an array of Y values. If it is a one-dimensional array, then it specifies a single vector of Y values. If it is a two-dimensional array, then the caYCast resource is used to determine which dimension indicates the number of vectors, and which dimension indicates the number of elements within each vector. If the caYArray resource is not set, then all of the X values set with the caXArray resource will be paired with their integer array index. For example, assuming caYCast is MultipleVectors and C array syntax:
 (xarray[0][0],1) (xarray[0][1],2) (xarray[0][N-1],N) If the caYArray resource is not set, then the caXArray resource must be set. Default: NULL 
caYCast This resource is used to tell the CoordArrays object how to interpret the caYArray resource. The three valid values are: SingleVector     The value SingleVector indicates that the caYArray provides the data for a single vector. This vector will be reused to match every vector specified by the caXArray. If the caYArray resource is set with a one dimensional array, then the entire array will be used for the vector. If the caYArray resource is set with a two dimensional array, then the vector will be made up from the values in the fastest changing dimension. For example, in pseudo C array notation:
     floatyarray[0][0-(N-1) ];     In pseudo Fortran array notation:
     REALYARR(1-N,1 )     Where N is the length of the given dimension. MultipleVectors     The value MultipleVectors indicates that if the caYArray resource is set with a one-dimensional array, then the entire array is used to specify a single vector that is not reused. If the caYArray resource is set with a two-dimensional array, then the caYArray has the array ordered such that the fastest-changing dimension contains the elements of each vector, and the other dimension contains the vectors. For example, in pseudo C array notation:
     floatyarray[NUM_VECTORS][NUM_ELEMENTS];     In pseudo Fortran arra y notation:
     REALYARR(NUM_ELEMENTS,NUM_VECTORS) SplitVec tors     The value SplitVectors indicates that the caYArray has the array ordered such that the fastest-changing dimension contains the vectors, and the other dimension contains the elements. For example, in pseudo C array notation:
     floatyarray[NUM_ELEMENTS][NUM_VECTORS];
         In pseudo Fortran array notation:
     REALYARR(NUM_VECTO RS,NUM_ELEMENTS) Default: <dynamic> If the caYArray resource is specified with a one-dimensional array or not at all, then the default value is SingleVector. Otherwise, the default value is MultipleVectors. Note: If the caYCast resource is set to SplitVectors, then the caYArray resource will need to be reordered and copied internally so it is not as efficient. 
caYMaxV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrays object the maximum value contained in the caYArrayresource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrays object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
caYMinV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrays object the minimum value contained in the caYArray resource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrays object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
caYMissingV This resource indicates a missing value for elements in the caYArray resource. When the HLU library is parsing the data in the caYArray elements, it will treat any element with this value as missing data. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: None 
cnCellFillEdgeColor If cnFillMode is set to CellFill, this resource specifies the color used to draw boundaries around the edges of the data grid cells that contain valid non-missing values. If set to the default value, Transparent, the boundaries do not appear. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Transparent (-1) 
cnCellFillMissingValEdgeColor If cnFillMode is set to CellFill, this resource specifies the color used to draw boundaries around the edges of the data grid cells that contain missing values. If set to the default value, Transparent, the boundaries do not appear. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Transparent (-1) 
cnConpackParams This string array resource allows you limited access to a number of parameters belonging to the LLU Conpack package, in order to control certain plot features for which ContourPlot does not yet have native resources. Each element of the array is a string consisting of a Conpack parameter name and its desired value separated by the colon character. Here is an example of its use in a resource file: *cnConpackParams: (/ RC1:0.05 , RC2:0.1 , RC3:0.05 , \  PC1:7.0 , PC2:20.0 , PC3:120.0 , PC4:0.01 , PC5:0.05 , PC6:0.05 , \  PW1:0.0 , PW2:0.0 , PW3:0.0 , PW4:0.0 /) If set programmatically, each string element would need to quoted as appropriate for the source language. The example given above includes all the parameters that affect the density of line labels when the cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Randomized or Computed. The example values should normally result in the appearance of more labels than the default settings. See the Conpack parameter descriptions for more information. Note that the only Conpack parameters accessible using the cnConpackParams resource are ones that ContourPlot does not set internally and are unlikely to have an interaction with parameters that ContourPlot does set. Here is a categorized list of the Conpack parameters that can be set using cnConpackParams: Contour hachuring control     HCL     HCS     HCF  High/low label density     HLX     HLY  Computed placement mode ("Penalty scheme" in Conpack) label density     PC1     PC2     PC3     PC4     PC5     PC6     PW1     PW2     PW3     PW4  Randomized placement mode ("Regular scheme" in Conpack) label density     RC1     RC2     RC3  Point interpolation for lines and edges     PIC     PIE  Note that you cannot get the value of cnConpackParams. Attempts to do so will result in an error. Default: NULL 
cnConstFEnableFill If the boolean resource cnConstFEnableFill is set to True, then in most cases, constant or near-constant fields will be rendered as a filled area, rather than having the contoured area remain blank. By default, the constant field informational text box will still appear; turn it off by setting cnConstFLabelOn to False. In the future, cnConstFEnableFill will likely default to True, with cnConstFLabelOn defaulting to False unless contour line drawing is enabled. Default: False 
cnConstFLabelAngleF This resource specifies the angle, in degrees, of the constant field label text and its surrounding box. Default: 0.0 
cnConstFLabelBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding the constant field label. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set cnConstFLabelBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Background (0) 
cnConstFLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when cnLineLabelFontQuality is set to High, the ContourPlot object writes constant field label text with proportional spacing. Setting the cnConstFLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF. When cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when cnConstFLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
cnConstFLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the constant field label. Default: "pwritx" 
cnConstFLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the constant field label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
cnConstFLabelFontColor This resource specifies the color to use for drawing constant field label text. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: True 
cnConstFLabelFontHeightF This resource controls the height, in NDC units, of characters used in the text of the constant field label. The character width scales proportionally, unless you also modify the aspect ratio using the cnConstFLabelFontAspectF resource. The constant field label text height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set cnConstFLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> -- 0.012 for a viewport width of 0.6 
cnConstFLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the ContourPlot constant field label. Default: High 
cnConstFLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw constant field label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the cnConstFLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
cnConstFLabelFormat The cnConstFLabelFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for the number generated from a substitution substring in the cnConstFLabelString according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. If any of the numerical format parameters have the dynamic attribute on, the corresponding parameter in the cnMaxDataValueFormat resource determines the parameter's value. The default value uses the shorthand notation '*+' to cause all numeric format parameters to be determined dynamically. Default: "*+^sg" 
cnConstFLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the constant field label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
cnConstFLabelJust This resource of type NhlTJustification, after constraint to an appropriate value based on cnConstFLabelSide, sets the justification of the constant field label annotation with respect to its base location. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the constant field label consistent with other annotations. Default: CenterCenter 
cnConstFLabelOn The ContourPlot object draws a constant field label annotation only when cnConstFLabelOn is set True and the ScalarField data are determined to have a single constant value within the limits of the available precision or when no ScalarField data are supplied. Default: True 
cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the constant field label annotation orthogonal to the current cnConstFLabelSide and directed away from the center of the viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the constant field label consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
cnConstFLabelParallelPosF cnConstFLabelParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the constant field label annotation parallel to the current cnConstFLabelSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the constant field label consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
cnConstFLabelPerimColor This resource sets the color to use for drawing the perimeter of the constant field label box. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnConstFLabelPerimOn cnConstFLabelPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether ContourPlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding the contour constant field label. If set False, no outline will be drawn. Default: True 
cnConstFLabelPerimSpaceF cnConstFLabelPerimSpaceF determines the spacing or margin between the text of the constant field label and the edge of the constant field label box as a fraction of the current label text height. Default: 0.33 
cnConstFLabelPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the constant field label box. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
cnConstFLabelSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the constant field annotation in relation to the sides of the plot object. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the constant field label consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources, cnConstFLabelParallelPosF and cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of the cnConstFLabelJust appropriately. There are four settings, which behave as follows, unless cnConstFLabelZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     PlotManager locates the constant field label annotation relative to a line that parallels the top viewport boundary. cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnConstFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. cnConstFLabelJust is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.  Bottom     PlotManager locates the constant field label annotation relative to a line that parallels the bottom viewport boundary. cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnConstFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. cnConstFLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, TopCenter, or TopLeft.  Right     PlotManager locates the constant field label annotation relative to a line that parallels the right viewport boundary. cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnConstFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. cnConstFLabelJust is constrained to TopLeft, CenterLeft, or BottomLeft.  Left     PlotManager locates the constant field label annotation relative to a line that parallels the left viewport boundary. cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnConstFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. cnConstFLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, CenterRight, or BottomRight.  If cnConstFLabelZone is set to 0, the PlotManager locates the constant field label annotation relative to the viewport center. If cnConstFLabelZone is 1, the direction of the cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the cnConstFLabelZone is either 0 or 1, cnConstFLabelJust is not constrained, and cnConstFLabelOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
cnConstFLabelString Specifies the string to use when drawing a constant field label. The string may contain function codes and/or substitution substrings. ContourPlot will replace the substring $ZDV$ with a number representing the constant field value. cnConstFLabelFormat determines the format of the number; its value will be scaled based on the value of cnLabelScaleFactorF. Default: "CONSTANT FIELD - VALUE IS $ZDV$" 
cnConstFLabelTextDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text in the constant field label. The choices are: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These directions apply before rotation due to cnConstFLabelAngleF. Default: Across 
cnConstFLabelZone ContourPlot implements the constant field label as an embedded annotation. cnConstFLabelZone specifies the PlotManager zone assigned to the constant field annotation. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the constant field label consistent with other annotations. If cnConstFLabelZone is set to 0, the positional origin is the center of the plot viewport; otherwise it is on or outside one of the sides of the viewport. If you create a ContourPlot object without an active PlotManager by setting tfPlotManagerOn False, then ContourPlot manages the constant field annotation by itself. In this case, the cnConstFLabelZone resource is not as meaningful. Default: 0 
cnConstFUseInfoLabelRes If the boolean resource cnConstFUseInfoLabelRes is set True, all the resources applying to the constant field, except for cnConstFLabelString, take their value from the corresponding informational label resources. Default: False 
cnExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn This boolean resource allows you control the labels that appear in the ContourPlot LabelBar explicitly. When set True, ContourPlot does not block the LabelBar resources lbLabelStrings and lbLabelAlignment. Therefore you can directly control both the contents of the LabelBar's label strings and their alignment with respect to the label boxes. When cnExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn is set False, ContourPlot sets both of these resources based on the current contour line labels and the value of the resource cnLabelBarEndStyle (as of version 5.0.0 or later) or (prior to version 5.0.0 or if cnLabelBarEndStyle is not set) cnLabelBarEndLabelsOn. If you set this resource True but do not set the lbLabelStrings array resource, ContourPlot will set it for you one time. This allows you to get an initial set of strings as a starting point for any customized tweaking you want to perform. Default: False 
cnExplicitLegendLabelsOn This boolean resource allows you control the labels that appear in the ContourPlot Legend explicitly. When set True, ContourPlot does not block the Legend resource lgLabelStrings. Therefore you can directly control the content of the Legend's label strings. When cnExplicitLegendLabelsOn is set False, ContourPlot sets lgLabelStrings based on the value of the current contour line labels. If you set this resource True but do not set the lgLabelStrings array resource, ContourPlot will set it for you one time. This allows you to get an initial set of strings as a starting point for any customized tweaking you want to perform. Default: False 
cnExplicitLineLabelsOn This boolean resource controls the way ContourPlot handles the cnLineLabelStrings array resource. When set True, ContourPlot will not modify explicitly set values of the line label strings. When cnExplicitLineLabelsOn is set False, ContourPlot ignores values of cnLineLabelStrings set by the user. Default: False 
cnFillBackgroundColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex or a named color (string) sets the background color used for ContourPlot fill patterns. It only has an effect for fill patterns that are neither SolidFill nor HollowFill. By default, this resource is set to Transparent, resulting in the underlying background appearing in the spaces between the elements of the fill pattern. If set to any other valid color index, the specified color will solidly fill all spaces between the fill pattern elements. Default: Transparent (-1) 
cnFillColor When cnMonoFillColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex or a named color (string) sets a uniform fill color for all contour fill areas. Default: Foreground (1) 
cnFillColors The elements of this array of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray can be set using an array of color indexes, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If cnMonoFillColor is False, each member of the array specifies the color of a contour fill area. Note that there is always one more fill area than there are contour levels. The first element of cnFillColors specifies the fill color for any region containing a data value less than the value of cnMinLevelValF, while the highest currently used element of cnFillColors specifies the fill color for regions containing data values greater than the value of cnMaxLevelValF. Although backwards compatibility is for the most part maintained, beginning with version 6.1.0, this resource supports the new 32-bit color model, as follows: If cnFillColors is not set explicitly, its values are derived from the settings of cnFillPalette and cnSpanFillPalette, or, if cnFillPalette is not set, wkColorMap and cnSpanFillPalette. If cnSpanFillPalette is True, the values are distributed evenly through the range of colors available from cnFillPalette or wkColorMap. Otherwise, the values are sequential. If the color indexes are derived from cnFillPalette the first color comes from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color comes from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. If some but not all of the available elements of cnFillColors are explicitly set, the remaining elements will be determined as if cnSpanFillPalette has the value False. For backwards compatibility, colors set based on wkColorMap remain indexed to the current color map associated with the workstation. Consequently, if the workstation color map is changed prior to drawing the plot, the color indexes will map into the new color map. In contrast, color indexes derived from the cnFillPalette resource always refer to a specific color regardless of changes to wkColorMap. Default: <dynamic> 
cnFillDotSizeF This resource sets a uniform dot size, in NDC units, for the stipple dot fill pattern. The default value of 0.0 causes the dots to be drawn as before, using a workstation dependent minimum dot size. A caveat is that individual dots are not clipped around the edges of fill areas; this becomes more noticeable as the dot size increases. Default: 0.0 
cnFillDrawOrder This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when areas of the contour plot are filled relative to the drawing of other elements of the plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Fill contour areas before the standard draw phase; fill areas will be overlaid by any subsequently drawn elements.  Draw     Fill contour areas during the standard draw phase; the fill will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw phase, but will underlie elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Fill contour areas after the standard draw; the fill will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw and draw phases.  You must manipulate this resource in order to mask contours within the context of an Overlay of multiple plot objects. Default: Draw 
cnFillMode This resource of type NhlTcnFillMode determines how ContourPlot performs fill when cnFillOn is set True. There are three choices: AreaFill     The area between contour levels is decomposed into polygons. The polygons are then filled based on the applicable fill color, fill pattern, the scale factor assigned to the pattern, and, if stipple fill (fill pattern 17) is specified, the size of the stippling dots.     The following resources can be used to control fill features when cnFillMode is set to AreaFill:         cnFillBackgroundColor         cnMonoFillColor         cnFillColor         cnFillColors         cnMonoFillPattern         cnFillPattern         cnFillPatterns         cnFillDotSizeF         cnMonoFillScale         cnFillScaleF         cnFillScales         cnGridBoundFillColor         cnGridBoundFillPattern         cnGridBoundFillScaleF         cnMissingValFillColor         cnMissingValFillPattern         cnMissingValFillScaleF         cnOutOfRangeFillColor         cnOutOfRangeFillPattern         cnOutOfRangeFillScaleF      Currently when using AreaFill mode, and cnScalarFieldData is specified using a MeshScalarField object, and the ContourPlot is overlaid on certain map projections, the edges of the plot may have a ragged appearance and not completely fill the projected data boundaries.  RasterFill     ContourPlot generates a representation of the data by individually assigning colors to the elements of a two-dimensional array of rectangular cells (a raster array) superimposed on an area bounding the data grid. With raster mode, only solid fill is possible, and therefore resources related to fill pattern specification have no effect. The color of each cell is determined based on the fill color assigned to the data value at the cell's location. If cnRasterSmoothingOn is set True, the data value for each raster cell is interpolated from the values of data grid cells in the neighborhood. Otherwise, each raster cell is assigned the color associated with the grid cell within which the greatest proportion of its area lies.     Beginning with version 6.2.0, the RasterFill mode fully supports transparency in a manner similar to the AreaFill and CellFill modes. Prior to version 6.2.0, if a fill index of Transparent was set for any cell of a raster fill plot, the Background fill color was used instead.     The following resources can be used to control fill features when cnFillMode is set to RasterFill:         cnFillColors         cnGridBoundFillColor         cnMissingValFillColor         cnOutOfRangeFillColor         cnRasterSmoothingOn         cnRasterMinCellSizeF         cnRasterSampleFactorF         cnRasterCellSizeF      Currently when using RasterFill mode, and trGridType is set to TriangularMesh, and the ContourPlot is overlaid on certain map projections, the edges of the plot may have a ragged appearance and not completely fill the projected data boundaries.  CellFill     ContourPlot performs cell fill by drawing filled polygons whose edges are defined by the borders between adjacent grid cells. If the data grid is defined using cell edges, the cell boundaries are obtained explicitly from the coordinate arrays. Otherwise, the edges are assumed to pass through the halfway points in data grid space between the cell centers. Optionally, you may draw lines around the edges using the cell fill edge resources. As with raster fill, pattern fill is not supported.     Beginning with version 6.2.0, the CellFill mode supports rendering of unstructured grids, including triangular grids, quadrilateral grids that cannot be fully defined using a 2D array, and geodesic grids with 5, 6, or more sided cells. In order to render such grids, the vertices of each cell must be explicitly specified using the MeshScalarField resources sfXCellBounds and sfYCellBounds.     The following resources can be used to control fill features when cnFillMode is set to CellFill:         cnMonoFillColor         cnFillColor         cnFillColors         cnMissingValFillColor         cnCellFillEdgeColor         cnCellFillMissingValEdgeColor      Prior to version 6.2.0, the CellFill mode was not available when cnScalarFieldData was specified using a MeshScalarField object.  Default: AreaFill 
cnFillOn This boolean resource controls whether the areas between contour levels are filled with a solid color and/or, if the fill method permits it, a fill pattern. You can choose between three fill methods by setting the resource cnFillMode. Default: False 
cnFillOpacityF Specifies the opacity of the fill colors of a contour plot. Give a value in the range of 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
cnFillPalette This resource of type NhlTColorDefinitionGenArray allows you to set a color palette from which the values assigned to cnFillColors are chosen. You can set this resource to the string name of a predefined color map, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If you set cnFillPalette using a predefined color map, it will have two fewer elements than if you set wkColorMap using the same color map. This is because the wkColorMap resource contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Use cnSpanFillPalette to indicate whether to span the full color palette or to simply use sequentially increasing values. Default: None 
cnFillPattern When cnMonoFillPattern is set True, this resource of type NhlTFillIndex sets a uniform pattern for all contour fill areas. Default: SolidFill 
cnFillPatterns If cnMonoFillPattern is False, each element of this array of type NhlTFillIndexGenArray specifies the fill pattern used for a contour fill area. Note that there is always one more fill area than there are contour levels. The first element of cnFillPatterns specifies the fill pattern for any region containing a data value less than the value of cnMinLevelValF, while the highest currently used element of cnFillPatterns specifies the fill pattern for regions containing data values greater than the value of cnMaxLevelValF. If the array is not set explicitly, the ContourPlot object will assign sequential fill pattern indexes (starting with fill index 1--not "SolidFill", which is fill index 0) to each array element up to the maximum number of existing fill patterns. Thereafter it will repeat the sequence using modular arithmetic. If the array currently contains fewer elements than cnLevelCount+1, more elements will be added to the array and given values according to the same assignment scheme; existing elements with valid fill pattern index values will not be modified. Default: <dynamic> 
cnFillScaleF When cnMonoFillScale is True, this resource sets a uniform scaling value for all contour fill patterns. Default: 1.0 
cnFillScales When cnMonoFillScale is False, the cnFillScales array resource allows individual control of the scaling of the pattern used for each contour fill area. It has no effect for solid fill (fill pattern "SolidFill", index 0). Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. Note that there is always one more fill area than there are contour levels. If the array is not set explicitly, the ContourPlot object will assign the value 1.0 to all elements of the array. If the array currently contains fewer elements than cnLevelCount+1, more elements will be added to the array and given the same default value of 1.0; existing elements with valid fill scale index values will not be modified. Default: 1.0 for all elements 
cnFixFillBleed When cnFillOn is set True and cnFillMode is set to AreaFill, ContourPlot performs area fill. Occasionally, due to limitations of the area rendering algorithm, this mode of fill fails and colors "bleed" out into areas they do not belong. If you have this kind of problem with your plot, it will probably be fixed if you set the resource cnFixFillBleed to True. However, there are certain kinds of plots that have problems when cnFixFillBleed is set True, and so far there is no clear algorithm for distinguishing these. Therefore, the corrections that are applied as a result of setting cnFixFillBleed cannot be yet be unconditionally coded into ContourPlot. Eventually, it is hoped that the need for this resource will be eliminated. Default: True (was False in NCL versions 6.0.0 and earlier) 
cnGridBoundFillColor This resource sets the color to use for filling areas outside the boundaries of the data grid, but within the viewport and the projectable areas of the underlying map, if any. cnFillOn must be set to True and cnGridBoundFillPattern must have a value other than HollowFill (-1) for this resource to have an effect. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Prior to version 6.2.0, if cnFillMode was set to RasterFill, the Background color was substituted if Transparent was specified for cnGridBoundFillColor. This resource is not supported for cnFillMode set to CellFill. Also note that the triangular mesh contouring algorithm does not distinguish between missing value areas and areas outside the grid boundary. Therefore if ContourPlot is given non-rectangular data or trGridType is explicitly set to TriangularMesh, the color index used will be the larger value of those assigned to the resources cnMissingValFillColor and cnGridBoundFillColor. Note that when this resource has a value other than Transparent and cnGridBoundFillPattern has a value other than HollowFill the value of cnMaxPointDistanceF is ignored. The underlying parameter it normally controls is constrained to the value 0.001. This is because the grid boundary needs to be calculated more precisely in this instance in order to correctly generate the fill areas on each side of the grid boundary. Default: Transparent (0) 
cnGridBoundFillPattern This resource sets the fill pattern index used to fill areas outside the boundaries of the data grid, but within the viewport and the projectable areas of the underlying map, if any. cnFillMode must be set to AreaFill, cnFillOn must be set to True, and cnGridBoundFillColor must have a value other than Transparent (-1) for this resource to have an effect. If cnFillMode is set to RasterFill only SolidFill is possible. This resource is not supported for cnFillMode set to CellFill. Note that the triangular mesh contouring algorithm does not distinguish between missing value areas and areas outside the grid boundary. Therefore if ContourPlot is given non-rectangular data or trGridType is explicitly set to TriangularMesh, the fill index used will be the larger value of those assigned to the resources cnMissingValFillPattern and cnGridBoundFillPattern. Default: SolidFill 
cnGridBoundFillScaleF The cnGridBoundFillScaleF resource controls the scaling of the pattern used for areas outside the boundaries of the data grid, but within the viewport and the projectable areas of the underlying map, if any. It has no effect for solid fill (fill pattern index Solid or 0) or whenever fill patterns are not enabled. Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. Note that the triangular mesh contouring algorithm does not distinguish between missing value areas and areas outside the grid boundary. Therefore if ContourPlot is given non-rectangular data or trGridType is explicitly set to TriangularMesh, the fill scale used will be the value assigned to cnMissingValFillScaleF unless it is set to the default value, 1.0. In that case it will be the value assigned to cnGridBoundFillScaleF. This resource is not supported for cnFillMode set to CellFill. Default: 1.0 
cnGridBoundPerimColor This resource sets the color to use for drawing the perimeter line around the grid boundary. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnGridBoundPerimDashPattern This resource sets the HLU index of a dash pattern used to render the perimeter line around the grid boundary. Default: 0 
cnGridBoundPerimOn If set True, this boolean resource specifies that a perimeter line be drawn around the grid boundary (extent of the ScalarField data) in the ContourPlot plot. Default: False 
cnGridBoundPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the grid boundary. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
cnHighLabelAngleF This resource specifies the angle, in degrees, of high label text and its surrounding box. Due to constraints imposed by the low level utilities, it also controls the angle of the low label text, even when cnLowUseHighLabelRes is set False. Default: 0.0 
cnHighLabelBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding each high label. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set cnHighLabelBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). Default: Background (0) 
cnHighLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when cnLineLabelFontQuality is set to High, the ContourPlot object writes line label text with proportional spacing. Setting the cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF. When cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when cnLineLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
cnHighLabelCount Each time a ContourPlot is drawn, the read-only resource cnHighLabelCount is updated with the number of high labels actually rendered in the plot. Until the plot is drawn for the first time cnHighLabelCount has the value 0; Default: 0 
cnHighLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render high labels. Default: "pwritx" 
cnHighLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the high label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
cnHighLabelFontColor This resource specifies the color to use for the high label text. If cnHighUseLineLabelRes is True, this resource takes its value from the first element of the cnLineLabelFontColors array. You can use a colorindex value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnHighLabelFontHeightF This resource controls the height, in NDC units, of characters used in the text of high labels. The character width scales proportionally, unless you also modify the aspect ratio using the cnHighLabelFontAspectF resource. The high label text height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set cnHighLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Due to constraints imposed by the low level utilities, it also controls the font height of the low label text, even when cnLowUseHighLabelRes is set False. Default: <dynamic> -- 0.012 for a viewport width of 0.6 
cnHighLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw ContourPlot high labels. Default: High 
cnHighLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw high label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the cnHighLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
cnHighLabelFormat The cnHighLabelFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for the numeric portion of high labels according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. If any of the numerical format parameters have the dynamic attribute on, the corresponding parameter in the cnMaxDataValueFormat resource determines the parameter's value. The default value uses the shorthand notation '*+' to cause all numeric format parameters to be determined dynamically. Default: "*+^sg" 
cnHighLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the high label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
cnHighLabelPerimColor This resource sets the HLU color index used to draw the perimeter of the high label box. Default: Foreground (1) 
cnHighLabelPerimOn cnHighLabelPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether ContourPlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding contour high labels. If set False, no outline will be drawn. Default: True 
cnHighLabelPerimSpaceF cnHighLabelPerimSpaceF determines the spacing or margin between the text of the high label and the edge of the high label box as a fraction of the current high label text height. Default: 0.33 
cnHighLabelPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the high label box. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
cnHighLabelString Specifies the string to use when drawing high labels. The string may contain function codes and/or substitution substrings. ContourPlot will replace the substring "$ZDV$" with a number representing the value at the point where the label is to appear. cnHighLabelFormat determines the format of the number and cnLabelScaleFactorF determines the scaling of the actual data value. Default: "H~B~$ZDV$~E~" 
cnHighLabelsOn If this boolean resource is set True, ContourPlot places labels at regions representing local maximums in the dataset. Default: False 
cnHighLowLabelOverlapMode cnHighLowLabelOverlapMode is a resource of type NhlTcnHighLowLabelOverlapMode. It controls how high and low labels are allowed to overlap other elements of the ContourPlot plot and has six possible settings: IgnoreOverlap     The ContourPlot object does nothing to prevent high and low labels from overlapping other elements of the ContourPlot plot.  OmitOverHL     The ContourPlot object omits high and low labels that would overlap previously determined high or low labels.  OmitOverVP     The ContourPlot object omits high and low labels that would overlap the edge of the viewport.  OmitOverVPAndHL     The ContourPlot object omits high and low labels that would overlap the edge of the viewport or previously determined high or low labels.  AdjustVP     The ContourPlot object adjusts the position of high and low labels that would overlap the edge of the viewport enough to eliminate the problem.  AdjustVPOmitOverHL     The ContourPlot object adjusts the position of high and low labels that would overlap the edge of the viewport enough to eliminate the problem and omits high and low labels that would overlap previously determined high or low labels.  V4.1 Status Note 5 Default: IgnoreOverlap 
cnHighUseLineLabelRes If the boolean resource cnHighUseLineLabelRes is set True, all resources applying to high labels, except for cnHighLabelString and cnHighLabelAngleF, take their value from the corresponding line label resources. Default: False 
cnInfoLabelAngleF This resource specifies the angle, in degrees, of the informational label text and its surrounding box. Default: 0.0 
cnInfoLabelBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding the informational label. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set cnInfoLabelBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Background (0) 
cnInfoLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when cnLineLabelFontQuality is set to High, the ContourPlot object writes informational label text with proportional spacing. Setting the cnInfoLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF. When cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when cnInfoLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
cnInfoLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the informational label. Default: "pwritx" 
cnInfoLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the informational label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
cnInfoLabelFontColor This resource specifies the color to use for the informational label text. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnInfoLabelFontHeightF This resource controls the height, in NDC units, of characters used in the text of the informational label. The character width scales proportionally, unless you also modify the aspect ratio using the cnInfoLabelFontAspectF resource. The info label text height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set cnInfoLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> -- 0.012 for a viewport width of 0.6 
cnInfoLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the ContourPlot informational label. Default: High 
cnInfoLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw informational label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the cnInfoLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
cnInfoLabelFormat The cnInfoLabelFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for the numbers generated from substitution substrings in cnInfoLabelString according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. If any of the numerical format parameters have the dynamic attribute on, the corresponding parameter in the cnMaxDataValueFormat resource determines the parameter's value. The default value uses the shorthand notation '*+' to cause all numeric format parameters to be determined dynamically. Default: "*+^sg" 
cnInfoLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the informational label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
cnInfoLabelJust This resource of type NhlTJustification, after constraint to an appropriate value based on cnInfoLabelSide, sets the justification of the informational label annotation with respect to its base location. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the informational label consistent with other annotations. Default: TopRight 
cnInfoLabelOn If this boolean resource is set False, ContourPlot will not draw an informational label. Default: True (False for gsn_csm contour routines when contour fill is turned on.) 
cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the informational label annotation orthogonal to the current cnInfoLabelSide and directed away from the center of the viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the informational label consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.02 
cnInfoLabelParallelPosF cnInfoLabelParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the informational label annotation parallel to the current cnInfoLabelSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the informational label consistent with other annotations. Default: 1.0 
cnInfoLabelPerimColor This resource sets the color to use for drawing the perimeter of the informational label box. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnInfoLabelPerimOn cnInfoLabelPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether ContourPlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding a contour informational label. If set False, no outline will be drawn. Default: True 
cnInfoLabelPerimSpaceF cnInfoLabelPerimSpaceF determines the spacing or margin between the text of the informational label and the edge of the informational label box as a fraction of the current label text height. Default: 0.33 
cnInfoLabelPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the informational label box. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. 
cnInfoLabelSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the informational annotation in relation to the sides of the plot object. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the informational label consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources, cnInfoLabelParallelPosF and cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of cnInfoLabelJust appropriately. There are four settings that behave as follows, unless cnInfoLabelZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     PlotManager locates the informational label annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnInfoLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. cnInfoLabelJust is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.  Bottom     PlotManager locates the informational label annotation relative to a line that parallels the bottom viewport boundary. cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnInfoLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. cnInfoLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, TopCenter, or TopLeft.  Right     PlotManager locates the informational label annotation relative to a line that parallels the right viewport boundary. cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnInfoLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. cnInfoLabelJust is constrained to TopLeft, CenterLeft, or BottomLeft.  Left     PlotManager locates the informational label annotation relative to a line that parallels the left viewport boundary. cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. cnInfoLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. cnInfoLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, CenterRight, or BottomRight.  If cnInfoLabelZone is set to 0, the PlotManager locates the informational label annotation relative to the viewport center. If cnInfoLabelZone is 1, the direction of the cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the cnInfoLabelZone is either 0 or 1, cnInfoLabelJust is not constrained, and cnInfoLabelOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
cnInfoLabelString Specifies the string to use when drawing an informational label. The string may contain function codes and/or substitution substrings. ContourPlot will replace the following substrings with numeric values: $CIU$     The contour interval used (value of cnLevelSpacingF)  $CMN$     The minimum contour level (first element of cnLevels)  $CMX$     The maximum contour level  $SFU$     The scale factor used (value of cnLabelScaleFactorF)  $ZMN$     The minimum data value  $ZMX$     The maximum data value  cnInfoLabelFormat determines the format of each number and except for the number generated from $SFU$, all values are scaled based on the value of cnLabelScaleFactorF. Default: "CONTOUR FROM $CMN$ TO $CMX$ BY $CIU$" 
cnInfoLabelTextDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text in the informational label. The choices are: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These directions apply before any rotation due to cnInfoLabelAngleF is applied to the informational label. Default: Across 
cnInfoLabelZone ContourPlot implements the informational label as an embedded annotation. cnInfoLabelZone specifies the PlotManager zone assigned to the informational annotation. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the informational label consistent with other annotations. If cnInfoLabelZone is set to 0, the positional origin is the center of the plot viewport; otherwise it is on or outside one of the sides of the viewport. If you create a ContourPlot object without an active PlotManager by setting tfPlotManagerOn False, then ContourPlot manages the informational annotation by itself. In this case, the cnInfoLabelZone resource is not as meaningful. Default: 3 
cnLabelBarEndLabelsOn When this boolean resource is set True and cnExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn is False, ContourPlot creates labels for the two ends of the LabelBar. The label at one end will be a string representation of the minimum value in the dataset, and at the other end will be a string representation of the maximum value in the dataset. Both strings will be formatted according to the format specification in effect for the other labels provided by ContourPlot to the LabelBar. As of version 5.0.0 or later this resource is deprecated and is overridden by cnLabelBarEndStyle when both are set at the same time. Default: False 
cnLabelBarEndStyle This enumerated resource of type NhlTLabelBarEndStyle allows you to select from among three styles for the ends of the ContourPlot LabelBar: IncludeOuterBoxes     The two end boxes represent the fill color and/or patterns used for areas of the plot where the data is below the minimum contour level or above the maximum contour level. The first and last labels, representing the minimum and maximum contour levels, are aligned with the interior boundaries of the outer boxes.  IncludeMinMaxLabels     The two end boxes represent the fill color and/or patterns used for areas of the plot where the data is below the minimum contour level or above the maximum contour level. The first and last labels, representing the minimum and maximum values in the field, are aligned with the exterior boundaries of the outer boxes. However, if the minimum and/or maximum field values fall within the range specified by the minimum and maximum contour levels, one or both of these labels will be set to an empty string.  ExcludeOuterBoxes     Only boxes representing fill colors and/or patterns between the minimum and maximum contour levels appear in the LabelBar. The first and last labels, representing the minimum and maximum contour levels, are aligned with the exterior boundaries of what have now become the outer boxes of the LabelBar. This setting is useful in cases where there exist maximum and minimum values that by the nature of the quantity always bound the data, e.g. probability or per cent cloud cover.  As of version 5.0.0 or later this resource overrides the now deprecated cnLabelBarEndLabelsOn when both are set at the same time. Default: IncludeOuterBoxes 
cnLabelDrawOrder This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when contour plot labels are drawn relative to the drawing of other elements of the plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw contour labels before the standard draw phase; the labels will be overlaid by any subsequently drawn elements.  Draw     Draw contour labels during the standard draw phase; the labels will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw phase as well as fill and contour lines drawn during the standard draw phase, but will underlie elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw contour labels after the standard draw; the labels will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw and draw phases as well as lines and fill drawn during the postdraw phase.  Default: Draw 
cnLabelMasking This resource controls whether ContourPlot lines and fill are masked in the areas where ContourPlot labels are to appear. When working with raster type devices, it is seldom necessary to mask for labels, since they can be made to solidly overlay the areas where they appear. Also there is a noticeable performance penalty when labels are masked, so the use of this option is discouraged unless it is necessary. Default: False 
cnLabelScaleFactorF cnLabelScaleFactorF is a read-only resource that contains the current scale factor that applies to ContourPlot object labels. Multiplying the numbers in the labels by the value of cnLabelScaleFactorF gives the actual data values the numbers represent. The ContourPlot object calculates its value based on the data value with the maximum absolute value, the current mode of the enumerated resource, cnLabelScalingMode, and perhaps the value of cnLabelScaleValueF. Its value may also be influenced by the number of significant digits specified by the format specification resource, cnMaxDataValueFormat. You may output the value of this resource in the informational label using the the substitution string "$SFU$". Default: <dynamic> 
cnLabelScaleValueF The interpretation of cnLabelScaleValueF depends on the value of the enumerated resource cnLabelScalingMode. When cnLabelScalingMode is set to ScaleFactor, data values are divided by the value of cnLabelScaleValueF to obtain the numbers appearing in ContourPlot object labels. If cnLabelScalingMode is set to ConfineToRange, the cnLabelScaleValueF represents an exclusive upper bound for the numbers used to represent the data values. For other values of cnLabelScalingMode, the cnLabelScaleValueF resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
cnLabelScalingMode This resource of type NhlTScalingMode determines how to scale the numbers representing scalar field data values in the ContourPlot object's labels. cnLabelScalingMode applies to numbers that represent data values in line labels, high and low labels, the informational label, and the constant field label. There are five choices: ScaleFactor     The ContourPlot object divides the data value by the value of cnLabelScaleValueF to obtain the number that appears in the label.  ConfineToRange     The ContourPlot object uses cnLabelScaleValueF as an exclusive upper bound. A scale factor is selected such that the number used to represent the data value with the maximum absolute value will be less than cnLabelScaleValueF, but greater than or equal to cnLabelScaleValueF divided by 10.0. As an example, setting cnLabelScaleValueF to 100.0 would result in a scaled number in the range 10.0 to 99.999....  TrimZeros     The ContourPlot object selects a scale factor such that the number representing the data value with the maximum absolute value will have the fewest possible extra zeros. If the maximum absolute value were 245000, for instance, it would scale to 245. If it were 0.000245, it would scale to 0.245. (The zero conventionally placed before the decimal point of a number less than 1.0 is not considered.)  MaxSigDigitsLeft     The ContourPlot object selects a scale factor such that the number representing the data value with the maximum absolute value will have its rightmost significant digit directly to the left of the decimal point. The number of significant digits is determined by the format string resource, cnMaxDataValueFormat.  AllIntegers     The ContourPlot object selects a scale factor such that the numbers representing labeled contour levels (as determined by examination of the values of the cnLevelFlags array) can be rendered as integers.  In each case, the scale factor selected is placed into the read-only resource, cnLabelScaleFactorF. Note that the label value multiplied by the scale factor returns the actual data value represented. Default: ScaleFactor 
cnLegendLevelFlags This array resource of type NhlTcnLevelUseModeGenArray allows you to control which of the lines representing contour levels are to appear in the ContourPlot Legend. You can also control whether the lines that do appear are to get a line label. Although the type allows for four choices, this resource supports only three of them: NoLine     Do not draw a line representing this contour level in the Legend.  LineOnly     Draw a line representing this contour level, but no label in the Legend.  LabelOnly     Currently, if an element is set to this value, it is treated the same as if it were set to NoLine.  LineAndLabel     Draw a line representing this contour level along with a line label in the Legend.  If you set this resource with an array containing fewer elements than the current number of contour levels, additional elements are supplied and set to the value NoLine. Default: NULL 
cnLevelCount A read-only resource set to the actual number of levels chosen during the level selection process. Default: <dynamic> 
cnLevelFlag When cnMonoLevelFlag is set True, this resource of type NhlTcnLevelUseMode sets the rendering of all contour levels to one of four possible values: NoLine     No lines or labels appear.  LineOnly     Lines but no labels appear.  LabelOnly     Labels but no lines appear.  LineAndLabel     Both lines and labels appear.  Note that the resources cnLinesOn and cnLineLabelsOn must both be set True to enable all possible settings of cnLevelFlag. Default: LineOnly 
cnLevelFlags When cnMonoLevelFlag is False, cnLevelFlags is an array of type NhlTcnLevelUseModeGenArray that allows you individual control over whether a line and/or a line label is to appear at each contour level. It has no effect on contour fill. There are four choices: NoLine     No lines or labels appear at the contour level.  LineOnly     Lines but no labels appear at the contour level.  LabelOnly     Labels but no lines appear at the contour level.  LineAndLabel     Both lines and labels appear at the contour level.  Note that cnLinesOn and cnLineLabelsOn exert underlying control over the appearance of contour lines and line labels. If cnLinesOn is set False, no lines will appear regardless of the values of any cnLevelFlags elements; likewise, if cnLineLabelsOn is False, no line labels will appear. If cnMonoLevelFlag is False and you do not explicitly set cnLevelFlags, the ContourPlot object will set its elements for you based on the value of cnLineLabelInterval. Elements will be set to LineOnly except that if cnLineLabelInterval is greater than 0, elements separated by the interval of cnLineLabelInterval will be set to LineAndLabel. This effect will occur both at initialization and any time you explicitly set cnLineLabelInterval. Default: <dynamic> 
cnLevelSelectionMode This enumerated resource of type NhlTLevelSelectionMode provides four methods for selecting the contour intervals displayed in a plot: AutomaticLevels     Ordinarily this mode determines contour levels by picking a spacing value from a set of relatively "round" numbers scaled by powers of 10 to the range of the data. This set of numbers is as follows: 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0. The number of levels chosen will be as close as possible to the value of cnMaxLevelCount without exceeding it. Once the spacing is chosen, the minimum contour level is set to the value of the least multiple of the spacing greater than the minimum data value. Likewise the maximum contour level becomes the greatest multiple of the spacing less than the maximum data value. Based on these values, ContourPlot sets the resources cnLevelSpacingF, cnMinLevelValF, and cnMaxLevelValF appropriately.     On the other hand, if you explicitly set the resource cnLevelSpacingF to a valid value greater than 0.0 and less than the range of the data, it will be used as the interval spacing. The minimum and maximum levels are calculated as before. If as a consequence, cnMaxLevelCount is less than the number of levels so specified, it will be set to the number of levels actually needed. However, if the choice of spacing causes the absolute maximum number of levels, currently 255, to be exceeded, ContourPlot will issue a warning message and recalculate the spacing as previously described.     In any case, ContourPlot sets the elements of the array resource cnLevels to the values of the contour levels chosen and the read-only resource cnLevelCount to the number of levels.  ManualLevels     ManualLevels mode bases the choice of contour levels on the values of the resources cnLevelSpacingF, cnMinLevelValF, and cnMaxLevelValF. Starting at cnMinLevelValF, contour levels are created at intervals spaced by the value of cnLevelSpacingF until cnMaxLevelValF is reached. The final contour level will always be cnMaxLevelValF. ContourPlot sets elements of the array resource cnLevels to the values of each contour level chosen and the read-only resource cnLevelCount to the number of levels. If the current value of cnMaxLevelCount is less than cnLevelCount, it is reset to the value of cnLevelCount. However, if the level count would exceed the absolute maximum number of levels, currently 255, ContourPlot issues a warning and chooses a new value of cnLevelSpacingF based on the value of cnMaxLevelCount.     If you choose ManualLevels selection mode when the ContourPlot object is created, and if you do not set cnMinLevelValF, ContourPlot will choose levels as if you had set AutomaticLevels mode. If you set cnMinLevelValF only, a default spacing is used, and the value of cnMaxLevelValF is determined as it would be for AutomaticLevels mode.  ExplicitLevels     This mode allows you to specify the value of each contour level by explicitly setting the contents of the cnLevels array. If you choose ExplicitLevels selection mode when creating a ContourPlot object, but do not specify the contents of the cnLevels array, ContourPlot will choose levels as if you had specified AutomaticLevels mode. Thereafter, when you set ExplicitLevels mode, ContourPlot uses the current contents of cnLevels, whether or not you set it explicitly.     If the number of elements in cnLevels exceeds the absolute maximum number of levels (currently 255), ContourPlot issues a warning and the mode defaults to AutomaticLevels. Note that ContourPlot always sorts the elements of cnLevels into a monotonically increasing sequence. After sorting, cnMinLevelValF is set equal to the value of first element of cnLevels, and cnMaxLevelValF is set to the value of the last element. cnLevelSpacingF is set to the average value of the spacing separating each level.  EqualSpacedLevels     For this mode, ContourPlot divides the range spanning the dataset minimum and maximum values into cnMaxLevelCount+1 equally spaced intervals.     ContourPlot sets cnLevelSpacingF to the value of this interval, cnMinLevelValF to the dataset minimum plus the value of cnLevelSpacingF, and cnMaxLevelValF to the value of the dataset maximum minus the value of cnLevelSpacingF. You cannot set these three resources yourself.     ContourPlot also sets the read-only resource cnLevelCount equal to cnMaxLevelCount.  Default: AutomaticLevels 
cnLevelSpacingF When the cnLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels or when the cnLevelSelectionMode is AutomaticLevels, and cnLevelSpacingF is explicitly set, cnLevelSpacingF determines the spacing between contour intervals. Otherwise, the ContourPlot object sets the value of cnLevelSpacingF based on the contour levels actually chosen. When the cnLevelSelectionMode is ExplicitLevels, cnLevelSpacingF will be set to the arithmetic average of the spacing between levels. Default: 5.0 
cnLevels An array of floats containing the contour levels used to render the contour plot. If the cnLevelSelectionMode is ExplicitLevels, you may set these values yourself. Otherwise, the ContourPlot object sets the elements of this array. Default: <dynamic> 
cnLineColor When cnMonoLineColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex or a named color (string). sets a uniform color for all contour lines. Default: Foreground (1) 
cnLineColors The elements of this array of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray can be set using an array of color indexes, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If cnMonoFillColor If cnMonoLineColor is False, each member of the array specifies the color of the contour line drawn at the corresponding contour level. Although backwards compatibility is for the most part maintained, beginning with version 6.1.0, this resource supports the new 32-bit color model, as follows: If cnLineColors is not set explicitly, its values are derived from the settings of cnLinePalette and cnSpanLinePalette, or, if cnLinePalette is not set, wkColorMap and cnSpanLinePalette. If cnSpanLinePalette is True, the values are distributed evenly through the range of colors available from cnLinePalette or wkColorMap. Otherwise, the values are sequential. If the color indexes are derived from cnLinePalette the first color comes from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color comes from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. If some but not all of the available elements of cnLineColors are explicitly set, the remaining elements will be determined as if cnSpanLinePalette has the value False. For backwards compatibility, colors set based on wkColorMap remain indexed to the current color map associated with the workstation. Consequently, if the workstation color map is changed prior to drawing the plot, the color indexes will map into the new color map. In contrast, color indexes derived from the cnLinePalette resource always refer to a specific color regardless of changes to wkColorMap. Default: <dynamic> 
cnLineDashPattern When cnMonoLineDashPattern is set True, this resource of type NhlTDashIndex sets a uniform dash pattern for all contour lines. Default: SolidLine (0) 
cnLineDashPatterns When cnMonoLineDashPattern is False, this array resource of type NhlTDashIndexGenArray individually sets the dash pattern of a contour line drawn at the corresponding contour level. If the array is not set explicitly, the ContourPlot object will assign sequential dash pattern indexes to each array element--starting with dash pattern index 1, not "SolidLine" (0)--up to the maximum number of existing dash patterns. Thereafter, it will repeat the sequence using modular arithmetic. If the array currently contains fewer elements than cnLevelCount, more elements will be added to the array and given values according to the same assignment scheme; existing elements with valid dash pattern index values will not be modified. Default: <dynamic> 
cnLineDashSegLenF This resource indicates the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to draw contour lines. It is the length in NDC units before the dash pattern repeats itself. If cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Constant the line labels are rendered as part of the dash pattern, and therefore cnLineDashSegLenF also controls the spacing between the line labels. cnLineDashSegLenF automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the ContourPlot object. ContourPlot sets its default value dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to the reference viewport width. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
cnLineDrawOrder This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when the contour lines are drawn relative to other elements of the plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw the contour lines before the standard draw; the lines will be overlaid by any subsequently drawn elements.  Draw     Draw the lines during the standard draw; the lines will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw phase, but will underlie elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw the lines after the standard draw; the lines will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw and draw phases.  Default: Draw 
cnLineLabelAngleF When cnLineLabelAngleF has a value less than 0.0, ContourPlot line labels are angled in the direction of the tangent of the contour line at the location of the label. Otherwise, cnLineLabelAngleF specifies the angle, in degrees, of all contour line labels. If cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Constant, this resource has no effect: the line labels are always placed along the contour line. Default: -1.0 
cnLineLabelBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding each line label. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set cnLineLabelBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). If cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Constant, this resource has no effect: a boxed background is not available. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Background (0) 
cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when cnLineLabelFontQuality is set to High, the ContourPlot object writes line label text with proportional spacing. Setting the cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF. When cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when cnLineLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
cnLineLabelCount Each time a ContourPlot is drawn, the read-only resource cnLineLabelCount is updated with the number of line labels actually rendered in the plot. Until the plot is drawn for the first time cnLineLabelCount has the value 0; Default: 0 
cnLineLabelDensityF The cnLineLabelDensityF resource provides simple, though not very precise, control over the number of line labels that appear in a contourplot. It has an effect only when cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Computed or Randomized. cnLineDashSegLenF controls the density of Constant mode line labels.. If cnLineLabelDensityF is set to its default value, 0.0, it has no effect and line label density can only be controlled by setting the appropriate low level parameters via the resource cnConpackParams. Setting cnLineLabelDensityF to 1.0 causes ContourPlot to use the default settings of the applicable low level resources, overriding any that are set through the cnConpackParams resource. Increase the number of line labels by setting cnLineLabelDensityF to values greater than 1.0, or decrease the number by setting it to positive values less than 1.0. You can obtain a count of the line labels drawn in the most recent rendering of the ContourPlot by retrieving the resource cnLineLabelCount. Default: 0.0 
cnLineLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render line labels. Default: "pwritx" 
cnLineLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the line label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
cnLineLabelFontColor When cnMonoLineLabelFontColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex or a named color (string) sets a uniform color for all contour line labels. Default: Foreground (1) 
cnLineLabelFontColors When cnMonoLineLabelFontColor is False, each element of this array of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray or named color (string) specifies the color of a contour line label. If the array is not set explicitly, it will dynamically default to a set of colors spread numerically over the range of defined HLU color indexes. The colors used will therefore depend on the number of contour levels. If the array currently contains fewer elements than cnLevelCount, more elements will be added to the array and given values according to the default color assignment scheme; existing elements with valid color index values will not be modified. You can use an array of color index values (integer) or named colors (string). Default: <dynamic> 
cnLineLabelFontHeightF This resource controls the height, in NDC units, of characters used in the text of line labels. The character width scales proportionally, unless you also modify the aspect ratio using the cnLineLabelFontAspectF resource. The line label text height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set cnLineLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> -- 0.012 for a viewport width of 0.6 
cnLineLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw ContourPlot line labels. Default: High 
cnLineLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw line label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the cnLineLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
cnLineLabelFormat The cnLineLabelFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for the numeric portion of line labels according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. It does not apply when the user explicitly sets the elements of cnLineLabelStrings. If any of the numerical format parameters have the dynamic attribute on, the corresponding parameter in the cnMaxDataValueFormat resource determines the parameter's value. The default value uses the shorthand notation '*+' to cause all numeric format parameters to be determined dynamically. Note that since the labels used for the ContourPlot LabelBar are copied from the cnLineLabelStrings resource the cnLineLabelFormat resource also controls the formatting of the LabelBar labels. This is true whether cnLineLabelsOn is set True or False. Default: "*+^sg" 
cnLineLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
cnLineLabelInterval When cnMonoLevelFlag is False and you do not explicitly set the array cnLevelFlags, a positive value of cnLineLabelInterval sets the number of levels from a labeled level to the next labeled level. The interval is generated in both directions from the contour level requiring the least number of significant digits to express (with the value 0.0 considered to require zero significant digits). If cnLineLabelInterval is less than or equal to zero, then no contour levels are labeled. Default: 2 
cnLineLabelPerimColor This resource sets the HLU color index used to draw the perimeter of the line label box. If cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Constant, this resource has no effect: no perimeter can be drawn around the label. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnLineLabelPerimOn cnLineLabelPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether ContourPlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding contour line labels. If set False, no outline will be drawn. If cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Constant, this resource has no effect: no perimeter can be drawn around the label. Default: True 
cnLineLabelPerimSpaceF cnLineLabelPerimSpaceF determines the spacing or margin between the text of the line label and the edge of the line label box as a fraction of the current line label text height. If cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Constant, this resource has no effect: no perimeter can be drawn around the label. Default: 0.33 
cnLineLabelPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the line label box. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. If cnLineLabelPlacementMode is set to Constant, this resource has no effect: no perimeter can be drawn around the label. Default: 1.0 
cnLineLabelPlacementMode This resource of type NhlTcnLineLabelPlacementMode determines the algorithm ContourPlot uses to place line labels. There are three choices: Constant     ContourPlot draws line labels as an integral part of the line dash pattern. As a result, the labels are equally spaced along the lines. You can control the spacing between the labels by setting the cnLineDashSegLenF resource.  Randomized     ContourPlot places labels using a randomizing algorithm to vary the distance between labels. You can increase or decrease the overall number of labels using the cnLineLabelDensityF resource. Or for more precise control, you can specify the appropriate low level parameter values yourself using cnConpackParams.  Computed     ContourPlot uses a more complex algorithm involving the local gradient, number of contour lines in a region, cumulative change in direction, and an optimum distance value to determine the best location for line labels. This method usually gives the best-looking results. You can increase or decrease the overall number of labels using the cnLineLabelDensityF resource. Or for more precise control, you can specify the appropriate low level parameter values yourself using cnConpackParams.     V4.1 Status Note 3  Default: Randomized 
cnLineLabelStrings Each element of the array resource cnLineLabelStrings specifies a string to be drawn at a contour level. Note that there is an element of this array for each contour level, whether or not (based on the contents of the cnLevelFlags array) a label will actually be drawn. If cnExplicitLineLabelsOn is set False, ContourPlot automatically sets the contents of the array to a set of strings representing the values of the contour levels, scaled based on the value of cnLabelScaleFactorF, and formatted based on the contents of cnMaxDataValueFormat and cnLineLabelFormat. If cnExplicitLineLabelsOn is set True, ContourPlot will not modify any initialized element of the array, thus allowing you to set its values to strings of your choice. If you set the resource with an array containing fewer elements than the current number of levels, the remaining elements will be assigned using the automatic method. Default: <dynamic> 
cnLineLabelsOn If this boolean resource is set False, contour line labels will not appear in the contour plot. Note that this resource overrides the values contained in the cnLevelFlags array resource with respect to line labels, but has nothing to do with whether contour lines appear. Default: True (False for gsn_csm contour routines when contour fill is turned on.) 
cnLinePalette This resource of type NhlTColorDefinitionGenArray allows you to set a color palette from which the values assigned to cnLineColors are chosen. You can set this resource to the string name of a predefined color map, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If you set cnLinePalette using a predefined color map, it will have two fewer elements than if you set wkColorMap using the same color map. This is because the wkColorMap resource contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Use cnSpanLinePalette to indicate whether to span the full color palette or to simply use sequentially increasing values. Default: None 
cnLineThicknessF When cnMonoLineThickness is True, this resource sets a uniform line thickness for all contour lines. Default: 1.0 
cnLineThicknesses If cnMonoLineThickness is False, each element of this array resource specifies the line thickness of a contour line drawn at the corresponding contour level. If the array is not set explicitly, all elements default to the value 1.0. If the array currently contains fewer elements than cnLevelCount, more elements will be added to the array and set to the default value, 1.0; existing elements with valid line thicknesses (greater than 0.0) will not be modified. Default: 1.0 for all elements 
cnLinesOn If this boolean resource is set False, no contour lines will appear in the contour plot, regardless of the values contained in the cnLevelFlags array resource. It has no effect on line labels. Default: True (False for gsn_csm contour routines when contour fill is turned on.) 
cnLowLabelAngleF Due to constraints imposed by the low level utilities, the low label text angle cannot be set independently of the high label text angle. Therefore, this resource is currently ignored. Use cnHighLabelAngleF.
cnLowLabelBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding each low label. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set cnLowLabelBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). Default: Background (0) 
cnLowLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when cnLineLabelFontQuality is set to High, the ContourPlot object writes line label text with proportional spacing. Setting the cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF. When cnLineLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when cnLineLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
cnLowLabelCount Each time a ContourPlot is drawn, the read-only resource cnLowLabelCount is updated with the number of low labels actually rendered in the plot. Until the plot is drawn for the first time cnLowLabelCount has the value 0; Default: 0 
cnLowLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render low labels. Default: "pwritx" 
cnLowLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the low label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
cnLowLabelFontColor This resource specifies the HLU color index used to render low label text. Default: Foreground (1) 
cnLowLabelFontHeightF Due to constraints imposed by the low level utilities, the low label font height cannot be set independently of the high label font height. Therefore, this resource is currently ignored. Use cnHighLabelFontHeightF.
cnLowLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw ContourPlot low labels. Default: High 
cnLowLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw low label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the cnLowLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
cnLowLabelFormat The cnLowLabelFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for the numeric portion of low labels according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. If any of the numerical format parameters have the dynamic attribute on, the corresponding parameter in the cnMaxDataValueFormat resource determines the parameter's value. The default value uses the shorthand notation '*+' to cause all numeric format parameters to be determined dynamically. Default: "*+^sg" 
cnLowLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the low label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
cnLowLabelPerimColor This resource sets the color to use to draw the perimeter of the low label box. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnLowLabelPerimOn cnLowLabelPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether ContourPlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding contour low labels. If set False, no outline will be drawn. Default: True 
cnLowLabelPerimSpaceF cnLowLabelPerimSpaceF determines the spacing or margin between the text of the low label and the edge of the low label box as a fraction of the current low label text height. Default: 0.33 
cnLowLabelPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the low label box. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
cnLowLabelString Specifies the string to use when drawing low labels. The string may contain function codes and/or substitution substrings. ContourPlot will replace the substring "$ZDV$" with a number representing the value at the point where the label is to appear. cnLowLabelFormat determines the format of the number and cnLabelScaleFactorF determines the scaling of the actual data value. Default: "L~B~$ZDV$~E~" 
cnLowLabelsOn If this boolean resource is set True, ContourPlot places labels at regions representing local minimums in the dataset. Default: True 
cnLowUseHighLabelRes If the boolean resource cnLowUseHighLabelRes is set True, all resources applying to low labels, except for cnLowLabelString, take their value from the corresponding high label resources. Note that, due to constraints imposed by the low level utilities, there are two low label attributes, font height and text angle, that are always controlled by the relevant high label resource, even when cnLowUseHighLabelRes is set False. In other words, although the resouces cnLowLabelAngleF and cnLowLabelFontHeightF exist, they are currently ignored. Default: False 
cnMaxDataValueFormat The cnMaxDataValueFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for the maximum data value according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. This resource serves as a master control for formatting any number representing ScalarField data when used in a ContourPlot label. If the format string for a label type sets the dynamic attribute for any of its numerical format parameters, the parameter's value is determined by the value of the corresponding parameter in the cnMaxDataValueFormat specifier. Thus, you can control the numerical format parameters for all labels by adjusting a single resource. For some format parameters, notably the leftmost significant digit parameter, you must use the dynamic attribute in order to apply the parameter in a meaningful way. Default: "*+.4^sg" 
cnMaxLevelCount When the cnLevelSelectionMode is AutomaticLevels and cnLevelSpacingF is not explicitly set, ContourPlot picks a number of levels less than or equal to the current value of cnMaxLevelCount. If the cnLevelSelectionMode is EqualSpacedLevels, ContourPlot picks exactly cnMaxLevelCount levels. If cnMaxLevelCount exceeds the absolute maximum level count allowed by ContourPlot (currently 255), a warning is issued and the value is reset to this maximum. If cnLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels or ExplicitLevels or AutomaticLevels with cnLevelSpacingF explicitly set, ContourPlot sets cnMaxLevelCount to the number of levels actually used if this number is greater than the current value of cnMaxLevelCount. Default: 16 
cnMaxLevelValF When the cnLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels, the value of cnMaxLevelValF, if set, determines the highest contour level. Otherwise, ContourPlot sets the cnMaxLevelValF to a value equal to the highest contour level picked. Default: <dynamic> 
cnMaxPointDistanceF Controls the maximum distance along both the width and height of the viewport allowed before checking for a discontinuous jump in the mapped coordinate points. The value specifies a fraction of the view width for the width check and a fraction of the view height for the height check. A value of 0.0 for this resource turns off this form of checking altogether. When non-zero, this value should not be set less than 0.001 or greater than 0.1. Smaller values increase processing time. Note that if cnGridBoundFillColor is set to anything other than its default of Transparent and cnGridBoundFillPattern is set to anything other than HollowFill, cnMaxPointDistanceF is ignored. The underlying parameter it normally controls is constrained to the value 0.001. This is because the grid boundary needs to be calculated more precisely in this instance in order to correctly generate the fill areas on each side of the grid boundary. Default: 0.05 
cnMinLevelValF When the cnLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels, the value of cnMinLevelValF, if set, determines the lowest contour level. Otherwise, ContourPlot sets the cnMinLevelValF to a value equal to the lowest contour level picked. Default: <dynamic> 
cnMissingValFillColor This resource sets the color to use for filling in missing value areas. cnFillOn must be set to True and cnMissingValFillPattern must have a value other than HollowFill (-1) for this resource to have an effect. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Prior to version 6.2.0, if cnFillMode was set to RasterFill, the Background color was substituted if Transparent was specified for cnMissingValFillColor. Also note that the triangular mesh contouring algorithm does not distinguish between missing value areas and areas outside the grid boundary. Therefore if ContourPlot is given non-rectangular data or trGridType is explicitly set to TriangularMesh, the color index used will be the larger value of those assigned to the resources cnMissingValFillColor and cnGridBoundFillColor. Default: Transparent (-1) (Background prior to version 6.0.0) 
cnMissingValFillPattern This resource sets the fill pattern index used to fill missing value areas. cnFillOn must be set to True and cnMissingValFillColor must have a value other than Transparent (-1) for this resource to have an effect. If cnFillMode is set to RasterFill or CellFil only SolidFill is possible. Note that the triangular mesh contouring algorithm does not distinguish between missing value areas and areas outside the grid boundary. Therefore if ContourPlot is given non-rectangular data or trGridType is explicitly set to TriangularMesh, the fill index used will be the larger value of those assigned to the resources cnMissingValFillPattern and cnGridBoundFillPattern. Default: SolidFill (HollowFill prior to version 6.0.0) 
cnMissingValFillScaleF The cnMissingValFillScaleF resource controls the scaling of the pattern used for missing values fill areas. It has no effect for solid fill (fill pattern index Solid or 0) or whenever fill patterns are not enabled. Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. Note that the triangular mesh contouring algorithm does not distinguish between missing value areas and areas outside the grid boundary. Therefore if ContourPlot is given non-rectangular data or trGridType is explicitly set to TriangularMesh, the fill scale used will be the value assigned to cnMissingValFillScaleF unless it is set to the default value, 1.0. In that case it will be the value assigned to cnGridBoundFillScaleF. Default: 1.0 
cnMissingValPerimColor This resource sets the color to use for drawing perimeter lines around missing value areas. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnMissingValPerimDashPattern This resource sets the HLU index of a dash pattern used to render perimeter lines around missing value areas. Default: 0 
cnMissingValPerimGridBoundOn If cnMissingValPerimOn is set True, then setting cnMissingValPerimGridBoundOn True causes complete perimeter lines to be drawn around the missing value areas, including along all edges of the data grid. When set False, missing value perimeter lines that coincide with the data grid edge are not drawn. If cnMissingValPerimOn is set False, this resource has no effect. Default: False 
cnMissingValPerimOn If set True, this boolean resource specifies that perimeter lines be drawn around missing value areas in the ContourPlot object. Unless cnMissingValPerimGridBoundOn is also set True, the portions of the missing value perimeter lines that overlap the data grid boundary are not drawn. Default: False 
cnMissingValPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of perimeter lines around missing value areas. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
cnMonoFillColor When set True, all contour fill areas are set to a single color, as specified by the value of the scalar resource cnFillColor. When False, the elements of the array resource cnFillColors control the color of each fill area individually. Default: False 
cnMonoFillPattern When set True, all contour fill areas use a single fill pattern, as specified by the value of the scalar resource cnFillPattern. When False, the elements of the array resource cnFillPatterns control the pattern used for each fill area individually. Default: True 
cnMonoFillScale When set True, all contour fill patterns are scaled by a single factor, as specified by the value of the scalar resource cnFillScaleF. When False, the elements of the array resource cnFillScales control the scaling applied to the fill pattern assigned to each fill area individually. Default: True 
cnMonoLevelFlag When cnMonoLevelFlag is set True, the scalar resource cnLevelFlag sets the level flag controlling the appearance of the line and/or the line label to a single value. In this case, the cnLineLabelInterval resource has no effect. Otherwise, when cnMonoLevelFlag is set False, you can set the level flag for each line individually using the resource cnLevelFlags, or set line labels to appear at uniform contour intervals using the resource cnLineLabelInterval. Default: False 
cnMonoLineColor When set True, all contour lines are set to a single color, as specified by the value of the scalar resource cnLineColor. Otherwise, the elements of the array resource cnLineColors control the color of each line individually. Default: True 
cnMonoLineDashPattern When set True, all contour lines are rendered using the same dash pattern, as specified by the value of the scalar resource cnLineDashPattern. Otherwise, the elements of the array resource cnLineDashPatterns control the dash pattern of each line individually. Default: True 
cnMonoLineLabelFontColor When set True, all contour line labels are rendered using a single color, as specified by the value of the scalar resource cnLineLabelFontColor. When False, the elements of the array resource cnLineLabelFontColors control the color of each line label individually. Default: True 
cnMonoLineThickness When set True, all contour lines are rendered using the same line thickness, as specified by the value of the scalar resource cnLineThicknessF. Otherwise, the elements of the array resource cnLineThicknesses control the thickness of each line individually. Default: True 
cnNoDataLabelOn This boolean resource, when set True, causes a label to appear when ContourPlot is drawn without any data having been provided. Except for the label string, all attributes of this label, including its position, are set using resources belonging to the constant field label. When set False, no such label appears. Default: True 
cnNoDataLabelString This resource contains the string that appears in the 'No Data' label if you draw a ContourPlot object without providing any data. No substitution substrings are allowed in this label, since all the substitutions depend on data being available. Except for the boolean switch that turns it on and off, all attributes of this label, including its position, are set using resources belonging to the constant field label. Default: "NO CONTOUR DATA" 
cnOutOfRangeFillColor This resource sets the color to use for filling areas within the viewport but outside the projectable area of the underlying map, if any. cnFillOn must be set to True and cnOutOfRangeFillPattern must have a value other than HollowFill (-1) for this resource to have an effect. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Prior to version 6.2.0, if cnFillMode was set to RasterFill, the Background color was substituted if Transparent was specified for cnOutOfRangeFillColor. This resource is not supported for cnFillMode set to CellFill. Default: Transparent (0) 
cnOutOfRangeFillPattern This resource sets the fill pattern index used to fill areas within the viewport but outside the projectable area of the underlying map, if any. cnFillOn must be set to True, and cnOutOfRangeFillColor must have a value other than Transparent (-1) for this resource to have an effect. If cnFillMode is set to RasterFill only SolidFill is possible. This resource is not supported for cnFillMode set to CellFill. Default: SolidFill 
cnOutOfRangeFillScaleF The cnOutOfRangeFillScaleF resource controls the scaling of the pattern used for areas within the viewport but outside the projectable area of the underlying map, if any. It has no effect for solid fill (fill pattern index Solid or 0) or whenever fill patterns are not enabled. Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. This resource is not supported for cnFillMode set to CellFill. Default: 1.0 
cnOutOfRangePerimColor This resource sets the color to use for drawing the perimeter lines around the edge of out-of-range areas. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
cnOutOfRangePerimDashPattern This resource sets the HLU index of a dash pattern used to render perimeter lines around the edge of out-of-range areas. Default: 0 
cnOutOfRangePerimOn If set True, this boolean resource specifies that perimeter lines be drawn around areas where the ScalarField data falls outside the current data boundaries of the plot. Default: False 
cnOutOfRangePerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of perimeter lines around the edge of out-of-range areas. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
cnRasterCellSizeF If this resource is explicitly set to a value greater than 0.0, it specifies the height and width of each cell of the raster array in NDC units. The number of cells in the raster array is determined by how many cells of the specified size it takes to cover a rectangular area bounding the data grid. In this case, the number of elements in the data grid, the resolution of the Workstation output device, and the setting of cnRasterSampleFactorF have no effect on the size of the raster cell array. No limit is placed on how small you may set this resource; it is not affected by the value of cnRasterMinCellSizeF. However, note that halving its size quadruples the overall number of cells in raster array, with consequent effects on processing time and memory usage. Once set, the value of this resource scales proportionally to changes in the viewport width, ensuring the same relative quality of output and processing time for any plot size. Giving cnRasterCellSizeF a value less than or equal to 0.0 has the effect of 'unsetting' the resource, restoring the default method of sizing the raster cell array based on the device resolution, the size of the data array, and the values of the resources cnRasterMinCellSizeF and cnRasterSampleFactorF. Even when unset, you may retrieve the value of this resource after a draw operation to find the minimum dimension of the cells in NDC units that was actually used to draw the plot. Default: <dynamic> 
cnRasterMinCellSizeF This resource supplies a lower limit for the size of a raster cell whenever ContourPlot determines the cell array density dynamically. It applies in all situations except when you set the cell size explicitly using cnRasterCellSizeF or you set cnRasterSampleFactorF to 0.0. It prevents the cell array from becoming unreasonably large when drawing a raster plot on a high-resolution workstation such as the PSWorkstation. Set it to a smaller value if you actually require plots at higher resolution. However, note that there is an inverse quadratic relationship between the value of this resource and the size of the cell array, with consequent effects on storage requirements and processing time. You can use a larger value if you want quick plots where detail is not so important. Default: 0.001 
cnRasterModeOn The cnRasterModeOn resource is deprecated in favor of the newer cnFillMode resource (you must set cnFillOn to True if you use cnFillMode). As long as cnFillMode is not set at the same time, it will continue to function as documented here, but eventually the documentation will be removed. If this boolean resource is set True, ContourPlot generates a representation of the data by individually assigning colors to the elements of a two-dimensional array of rectangular cells superimposed on an area bounding the data grid. This contrasts with the area fill method, in which a plot is generated by coloring the irregular areas formed by the boundaries of the lines defining adjacent contour levels. When raster mode is in effect, only solid fill is possible, and therefore the following resources have no effect:     cnFillBackgroundColor     cnMonoFillColor     cnFillColor     cnMonoFillPattern     cnFillPattern     cnFillPatterns     cnFillDotSizeF     cnMonoFillScale     cnFillScaleF     cnFillScales     cnGridBoundFillPattern     cnGridBoundFillScaleF     cnMissingValFillPattern     cnMissingValFillScaleF     cnOutOfRangeFillPattern     cnOutOfRangeFillScaleF  The color chosen for each cell is based on the color indexes contained in the cnFillColors array resource unless the cell center is in a missing-value area or outside the grid. If the cell center is in a missing-value area, it is given the value of the resource cnMissingValFillColor. If it is outside the data grid, it is given the value of the resource cnGridBoundlFillColor and if it is outside the projectable area of the underlying map it is given the value of the resource cnOutOfRangeFillColor. Prior to version 6.2.0, the Background color was substituted if Transparent was specified for any of these resources when raster mode was in effect. In general, within the limits of the Workstation output device resolution, the quality of a raster plot improves as the density of the cell array is increased. However, processing time and memory requirements also increase. Default: False 
cnRasterSampleFactorF If cnRasterCellSizeF is not explicitly set, ContourPlot adjusts the raster cell size dynamically in order to create a plot with as much resolution as is necessary and/or practical, while simultaneously trying to keep the cell array as small as possible. The default minimum cell size is the workstation device pixel size or the value of cnRasterMinCellSizeF, whichever is bigger. ContourPlot uses this minimum size as the default dynamic size whenever cnRasterSmoothingOn is True. If cnRasterSmoothingOn is False, ContourPlot uses a larger default size if there is a linear mapping from data to NDC space and if the data grid has a lower resolution than a grid of minimum-sized cells would have. Linearity is considered separately along each axis: if the plot has one log axis and one linear axis, for example, rectangular cells may be created with the dimension along the log axis set to the minimum size while the linear dimension has a much larger size. If the plot is overlaid on a map projection, cells are set to the minimum size except for the special case of a non-rotated cylindrical equidistant projection with the center latitude set to 0.0. Based on the dynamically determined default cell size and the NDC width and height of the data extent, ContourPlot calculates the number of cells needed along each dimension of the cell array. The cnRasterSampleFactorF resource acts as a multiplier of the number of raster cells along each dimension. Setting it to 2.0, for example, would double the number of cells along each axis, quadrupuling the overall size of the cell array. However, if this operation would result in the cells falling below the minimum size specified by cnRasterMinCellSizeF, their number is limited as required along the affected dimension. You can set cnRasterSampleFactorF to a value less than 1.0 in order improve plotting speed; the tradeoff will be diminished plot quality. As a special case, if cnRasterSampleFactorF is set to 0.0, ContourPlot creates the cell array the same size as the data array, resulting in a one-to-one correspondence between data grid points and cells in the raster array. This is regardless of the Workstation device resolution or the setting of cnRasterMinCellSizeF. Default: 1.0 
cnRasterSmoothingOn If cnRasterSmoothingOn is set True, the level (and hence the color) assigned to each cell is determined by interpolating the values of neighboring points in the data grid. If cnRasterSmoothingOn is False, ContourPlot creates a discrete raster plot: any raster cell whose center lies within the rectangular area bounded by lines halfway between each grid point (in data space) is given the color assigned to the level representing the grid point datum. The effect of this resource on the appearance of the plot depends on the density of the data relative to the number of cells in the raster array as limited by the resolution of the Workstation output device. If the data grid is more densely spaced than the cell array, two plots generated with opposite settings of this resource will appear qualitatively similar, although there may be differences of detail. However, if the data grid is sparse relative to the cell array density, turning smoothing off results in a plot that appears blocky and discontinuous compared to a plot drawn with smoothing turned on. Default: False 
cnScalarFieldData Specifies the id of a data object belonging to the ScalarField class or its subclass MeshScalarField. There is no default for this resource; it is the only resource that must be set for the ContourPlot object to draw a plot. You may create a ContourPlot object without setting the cnScalarFieldData, and auxiliary annotations such as tick marks and titles may appear as the result of a draw, but the ContourPlot itself will not show up. Use a regular ScalarField object for topologically rectangular gridded data. This is data that can be specified using a two-dimensional array with the common property that, for any interior element of the array e[j,i], a line through the location of the 8 elements e[j +/- 1, i +/- 1] would separate the element e[j,i] from the locations in data space of all other elements. You may define the coordinate space of the ScalarField data array using 1 or 2 dimensional coordinate arrays, or simply by setting the start and end locations along each axis. If you do not set any coordinate array resources the coordinate space defaults to the the array index extents. Use a MeshScalarField object if the data cannot be specified using a two-dimensional array as described above, but you can specify the location of each data element explicitly. You must set each data value and its location along the X and Y Axes as the corresponding elements of three one-dimensional arrays. You may explicitly or implicitly specify the mesh to be created from the data nodes using MeshScalarField resources. If you do not specify the mesh, ContourPlot generates it by calculating a Delauney triangulation in the projection plane, using Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle package. Default: <None> 
cnSmoothingDistanceF When the boolean resource cnSmoothingOn is set to True (it is False by default), the ContourPlot object will use cnSmoothingDistanceF to help control the parameters of the smoothing algorithm. cnSmoothingDistanceF sets the distance between points used to draw smoothed contour lines. It is expressed as a fraction of the width of the window in the coordinate system in which smoothing is being performed. Note that processing time is affected greatly by the value given to the smoothing distance. Smaller values add to the processing time. Default: 0.01 
cnSmoothingOn When the boolean resource cnSmoothingOn is True, the ContourPlot object will smooth the contours using cubic splines under tension. The resources cnSmoothingTensionF and cnSmoothingDistanceF control the parameters of the smoothing algorithm. Note that when smoothing is turned on, it is possible in some cases for adjacent contour lines to cross each other. In this case, you need to adjust the cnSmoothingTensionF experimentally in order to eliminate the problem. Default: False 
cnSmoothingTensionF When the boolean resource cnSmoothingOn is set to True (it is False by default), the ContourPlot object will use cnSmoothingTensionF to help control the parameters of the smoothing algorithm. If you give cnSmoothingTensionF a value of 0.0, smoothing is turned off. If you give it a negative value, the ContourPlot object performs smoothing prior to any transformations of the data space; if you make it positive, smoothing takes place after any data space transformations. Small absolute values on the order of 0.001 give 'loopy' curves, which are rather likely to cross each other. Large absolute values give tight, nearly polygonal curves. V4.1 Status Note 4 Default: -2.5 
cnSpanFillPalette If set to True, and if cnFillColors is not set using explicit values, then ContourPlot automatically spans the cnFillPalette resource to determine color index values for cnFillColors. If cnFillPalette is not set then the wkColorMap resource is spanned instead. If set to False, then ContourPlot uses consecutively ascending values to populate cnFillColors. If the colors are derived from cnFillPalette the first color will be determined from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color will come from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Default: True 
cnSpanLinePalette If set to True, and if cnLineColors is not set using explicit values, then ContourPlot automatically spans the cnLinePalette resource to determine color index values for cnLineColors. If cnLinePalette is not set then the wkColorMap resource is spanned instead. If set to False, then ContourPlot uses consecutively ascending values to populate cnLineColors. If the color indexes are derived from cnLinePalette the first color will be determeined from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color comes from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Default: True 
ctCopyTables This resource is used to determine if the CoordArrTable object should make its own copy of the ctXTable and ctYTable data. If this resource is False, it is important for the programmer to keep the data around without modifying it. Default: True 
ctXElementSize This resource is used to indicate the size of each element of each vector in the ctXTable resource. If the ctXTable resource is set, and this one is not, then the CoordArrTable object will use the ctXTableType resource to try to determine the size of each element; therefore this resource is usually not necessary. Default: <dynamic> Determined from ctXTableType if possible. 
ctXMaxV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrTable object the maximum value contained in the ctXTable resource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrTable object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
ctXMinV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrTable object the minimum value contained in the ctXTable resource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrTable object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
ctXMissingV This resource indicates a missing value for elements in the ctXTable resource. When the HLU library is parsing the data in the ctXTable elements, it will treat any element with this value as missing data. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. It is important to realize that the elements in ctXTable will be converted to float, and the contents of this resource will be converted to float, before the elements are compared with the value of this resource. Default: None 
ctXTable This resource specifies the X values of the X/Y coordinate data. It is an array of X vectors. Each vector is actually a single-dimension array of type ctXTableType. The length of each vector array is determined by the corresponding element of the ctXTableLengths resource. If this resource is set, then the corresponding ctXTableLengths resource must also be set. If the ctXTable resource is not set, then all of the Y values set with the ctYTable resource will be paired with their integer array index. For example, (1, (ytable[0])[0]) (2, (ytable[0])[1]) (ytable_lengths[0], (ytable[0])[ytable_lengths[0]-1]) If one of the vectors in the ctXTable resource is NULL, then it is interpreted to contain an integer array index vector as well, with the ctXTableLengths resource indicating the length of the vector. If the ctXTable resource is not set, then the ctYTable resource must be set. Default: NULL 
ctXTableLengths This resource is a one-dimensional integer array. Each element of the array indicates the length of the corresponding vector in the ctXTable resource. This resource must be set if the ctXTable resource is set. Default: NULL 
ctXTableType This resource is used to indicate the type of each element of each vector in the ctXTable resource. It is a string value of the type's name. For example, "Integer". There are symbols provided to the C interface for all the available types. "Integer" would be set with NhlTInteger. Default: NULL This resource must be set if the ctXTable resource is set. 
ctYElementSize This resource is used to indicate the size of each element of each vector in the ctYTable resource. If the ctYTable resource is set, and this one is not, then the CoordArrTable object will use the ctYTableType resource to try to determine the size of each element; therefore this resource is not usually necessary. Default: <dynamic> Determined from ctYTableType if possible. 
ctYMaxV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrTable object the maximum value contained in the ctYTable resource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrTable object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
ctYMinV This resource is used to tell the CoordArrTable object the minimum value contained in the ctYTable resource. If it is not specified, the CoordArrTable object will compute it. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. Default: <dynamic> The value will be computed if it is not set. 
ctYMissingV This resource indicates a missing value for elements in the ctYTable resource. When the HLU library is parsing the data in the ctYTable elements, it will treat any element with this value as missing data. This resource has a dynamic type so that elements of any type can be set to it. It is important to realize that the elements in ctYTable will be converted to float, and the contents of this resource will be converted to float, before the elements are compared with the value of this resource. Default: None 
ctYTable This resource specifies the Y values of the X/Y coordinate data. It is an array of Y vectors. Each vector is actually a single-dimension array of type ctYTableType. The length of each vector array is determined by the corresponding element of the ctYTableLengths resource. If this resource is set, then the corresponding ctYTableLengths resource must also be set. If the ctYTable resource is not set, then all of the X values set with the ctXTable resource will be paired with their integer array index. For example, ((xtable[0])[0], 1) ((xtable[0])[1]), 2) ((xtable[0])[xtable_lengths[0]-1],xtable_lengths[0]) If one of the vectors in the ctYTable resource is NULL, then it is interpreted to contain an integer array index vector as well, with the ctYTableLengths resource indicating the length of the vector. If the ctYTable resource is not set, then the ctXTable resource must be set. Default: NULL 
ctYTableLengths This resource is a one-dimensional integer array. Each element of the array indicates the length of the corresponding vector in the ctYTable resource. This resource must be set if the ctYTable resource is set. Default: NULL 
ctYTableType This resource is used to indicate the type of each element of each vector in the ctYTable resource. It is a string value of the type's name. For example, "Integer". There are symbols provided to the C interface for all the available types. "Integer" would be set with NhlTInteger. Default: NULL This resource must be set if the ctYTable resource is set. 
dcDelayCompute This resource is used to indicate if the DataComm object should buffer its response to changes in DataItem objects that are associated with data resources in the DataComm object. If this resource is False, then the DataComm object will immediately update its internal state to changes the user makes to an associated DataItem. If this resource is True, then the DataComm object will wait until the user tries to draw the DataComm object, or they call the UpdateData function. It may be useful to set this resource True, if a particular data resource has a number of DataItems associated with it and each one of the DataItems are modified. In this case, if the dcDelayCompute resource is True, then the DataComm object will only recompute data extents once, instead of recomputing them every single time each of the associated DataItem objects is modified. Default: False 
errBuffer This resource determines if error messages should be buffered so they can be extracted by the application programmer at a later time. Default: False 
errFileName Specifies the file to print error messages to. The error object understands the file names "stderr" and "stdout" to be the streams associated with those standard FILE pointers in the UNIX environment. If the Error object is in Fortran mode, it will still interpret the "stderr" and "stdout" file names. If the errUnitNumber resource is not set, then the library will use the appropriate unit numbers for these standard UNIX streams. The error object will try to create a file of any other name relative to the current directory or append to that file if it already exists. Default: "stderr" Note:If the Error obj ect is in C mode, and the errFilePtr resource is set, then this resource is ignored. Also, if the Error object is in Fortran mode, and the errUnitNumber is set to an Open unit, this resource is ignored. 
errFilePtr This resource is only used if the HLU library is initialized with one of the C functions NhlInitialize or NhlOpen. This resource specifies the C file pointer to print the error messages to, if the errPrint resource is True. If this resource is set, then the errFileName resource is ignored. Default: NULL 
errLevel Specifies the error level that should be reported. Any error message that is less severe than this level will not be reported or buffered. Default: WARNING 
errPrint Used to determine if error messages should be printed or not. If they are, they are printed to the file indicated by the errFileName, errFilePtr and errUnitNumber resources. Default: True 
errUnitNumber This resource is only used if the HLU library is initialized with one of the Fortran routines NHLFINITIALIZE or NHLFOPEN. This resource specifies the Fortran unit number to print the error messages to if the errPrint resource is True. If the unit number has already been opened, then the Error object ignores the errFileName resource. If the unit number has not been opened yet, then the Error object attempts to open the file. If the errFileName resource has been set, then it uses that name, otherwise it doesn't. If this resource is not set, then the Error object just uses the errFileName resource to determine where it should print error messages. Default: 74 Note: If the errFileName resource is set to either "stdout" or "stderr", then this defaults to the appropriate unit numbers for those standard UNIX streams, usually 6 and 0 respectively. 
gsClipOn This resource controls whether primitives are clipped to the plot viewport. When set to the default value, True, any parts of the primitive drawn outside the viewport will not appear. If set to False these elements of the primitive will appear, except in the case of data primitives drawn using a MapTransformation or an IrregularTransformation. In these cases the data space is undefined outside the viewport boundary and therefore the location of the primitives cannot be determined. Default: True 
gsColors This resource allows you to set an array of fill or line color indexes for polygons or polyline segments being drawn on or attached to a plot via the gsSegments resource, so it should have the same size as gsSegments. If it contains fewer elements, then the values will be recycled as often as required to draw all segments. Default: None 
gsEdgeColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex specifies the color used for the edges of fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: Foreground 
gsEdgeDashPattern This resource of type NhlTDashIndex specifies the dash pattern for the edges of fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0 
gsEdgeDashSegLenF This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash pattern used for the edges of fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: .15 
gsEdgeThicknessF This resource specifies the thickness of the edges of fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
gsEdgesOn If this boolean resource is set True, fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object are rendered with a line drawn around all visible edges. Default: False 
gsFillBackgroundColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets the color used as the background of fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: Transparent 
gsFillColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets the color used for fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: Foreground 
gsFillDotSizeF This resource sets a uniform dot size, in NDC units, for the stipple dot fill pattern. The default value of 0.0 causes the dots to be drawn as before, using a workstation dependent minimum dot size. A caveat is that individual dots are not clipped around the edges of fill areas; this becomes more noticeable as the dot size increases. Default: 0.0 
gsFillIndex This resource of type NhlTFillIndex sets the fill pattern used for fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0 
gsFillLineThicknessF This resource specifies the thickness of lines used within the fill patterns of fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 1.0 
gsFillOpacityF Sets the opacity of filled polygons. Specify a floating-point value in the range of 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
gsFillScaleF This resource specifies the fill pattern scaling factor for fill primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 1.0 
gsFont This resource specifies the font used to render text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: pwritx 
gsFontAspectF This resource specifies the font aspect ratio for text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 1.3125 
gsFontColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex specifies the color of text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: Foreground 
gsFontHeightF This resource specifies the font height for text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0.015 
gsFontOpacityF Sets the opacity of text drawn as graphics on a plot. Specify a floating-point value in the range of 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
gsFontQuality This resource of type NhlFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to render text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. There are three choices: High     Draw characters using any of the stoked or filled fonts.  Medium     Draw characters using a 94-character stroked font that is simpler than the High quality fonts, resulting in somewhat smaller metafiles. The gsFont resource is ignored.  Low     The characters are output as a string into the metafile. The quality of the output therefore depends on the fonts available to the metafile translator. When NCAR Graphics translators are used, the font quality is similar to that of Medium text. The gsFont resource is ignored.  Default: High 
gsFontThicknessF This resource specifies the font thickness for text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
gsLineColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex specifies the color of line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: Foreground 
gsLineDashPattern This resource of type NhlTDashIndex specifies the dash pattern for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0 
gsLineDashSegLenF This resource indicates the length of each segment of a dash pattern used for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. It is the length in NDCs before the dash pattern repeats itself. If line labels are being drawn, this is also the length between the end of one label and the start of the next. Default: 0.15 
gsLineLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when gsLineLabelFontQuality is set to High, line labels for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object are rendered using proportional spacing. Setting the gsLineLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of gsLineLabelConstantSpacingF. When gsLineLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when gsLineLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
gsLineLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the line label font for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0 
gsLineLabelFontAspectF This resource specifies the line label font aspect ratio for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 1.3125

gsLineLabelFontHeightF This resource specifies the line label font height for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0.0125 
gsLineLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality specifies the quality of the line label font for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: High 
gsLineLabelFontThicknessF This resource specifies the line label font thickness for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
gsLineLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the line label function code used for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
gsLineLabelString This resource specifies the string used as the line label for line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: <dynamic> 
gsLineOpacityF Sets the opacity of polyline or polygon boundaries. Specify a floating-point value in the range of 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
gsLineThicknessF This resource specifies the thickness of line primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
gsMarkerColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex specifies the color of marker primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: Foreground 
gsMarkerIndex This resource of type NhlTMarkerIndex specifies the marker glyph for marker primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: "asterisk" 
gsMarkerOpacityF Sets the opacity of marker symbols. Specify a floating-point value in the range of 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
gsMarkerSizeF This resource specifies the NDC size of marker primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0.007 
gsMarkerThicknessF This resource specifies the thickness of the lines used to render marker primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
gsSegments This resource allows you specify an array of indexes into the X/Y point arrays to indicate the start of each new line or polygon segment. This allows you to treat multiple line or polygon segments as a single composite polyline or polygon. Using this resource can significantly speed up code that is adding thousands of segments to a plot. It is only available with polyline and polygon drawing codes like gsn_add_polyline, gsn_add_polygon, NhlDataPolyline, and NhlDataPolygon. The gsColors allows you to specify an array of color indexes associated with each line or polygon segment in gsSegments. Default: None 
gsTextAngleF This resource specifies the rotation angle around the justification point of text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: 0.0 
gsTextConstantSpacingF Normally when gsFontQuality is set to High, text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object are rendered using proportional spacing. Setting the gsTextConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of gsTextConstantSpacingF. When gsTextConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when gsFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
gsTextDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These descriptions apply before any rotation due to gsTextAngleF is applied to the text primitive. Default: Across 
gsTextFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter specifies the function code used for text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
gsTextJustification This resource of type NhlJustification sets the justification point for text primitives associated with the GraphicStyle object. Default: CenterCenter 
gsnAboveYRefLineBarColors If gsnYRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what colors to use in filling the bars above the given Y reference line. The colors will repeat if there are fewer colors than bars. Default: None
gsnAboveYRefLineBarFillScales If gsnYRefLine is set, gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and gsnAboveYRefLineBarPatterns is set, then this resource indicates what fill scales to use for the fill patterns. Values less than 1.0 give you a more dense pattern. Default: 1.0
gsnAboveYRefLineBarPatterns If gsnYRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what patterns to use in filling the bars above the given Y reference line. The gsnXYBarChartPatterns resource will be ignored. The patterns will repeat if there are fewer patterns than bars. Default: 0 (solid fill)
gsnAboveYRefLineColor If gsnYRefLine is set, then this resource fills the curve above the Y reference line with the given color. Default: None
gsnAddCyclic For geo-referenced data, a longitude cyclic point is added as a default to ensure a gap is not plotted at the Greenwich Meridian. This resource only applies to gsn_csm plotting routines that overlay data on a map. This resource should be set to False if your data already has a cyclic point added, or if your data does not cover the whole globe to start with. This resource defaults to True for many gsn_csm_xxxx scripts that create contour, vector, or streamline plots, unless the function can determine automatically that this is not cyclic data. Default: dynamic
gsnAttachBorderOn By default, the gsn_attach_plots routine does not remove the interior borders when you attach a series of plots. If this resource is set to False, then the interior borders will be removed. Default: True
gsnAttachPlotsXAxis By default, the gsn_attach_plots routine attaches plots by attaching the right Y axis of the current plot to the left Y axis of the next plot. If this resource is set to True, then the plots will be attached at the bottom X axis of the current plot and the top X axis of the next plot. Default: False
gsnBelowYRefLineBarColors If gsnYRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what colors to use in filling the bars below the given Y reference line. The colors will repeat if there are fewer colors than bars. Default: None
gsnBelowYRefLineBarFillScales If gsnYRefLine is set, gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and gsnBelowYRefLineBarPatterns is set, then this resource indicates what fill scales to use for the fill patterns. Values less than 1.0 give you a more dense pattern. Default: 1.0
gsnBelowYRefLineBarPatterns If gsnYRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what patterns to use in filling the bars below the given Y reference line. The gsnXYBarChartPatterns resource will be ignored. The patterns will repeat if there are fewer patterns than bars. Default: 0 (solid fill)
gsnBelowYRefLineColor If gsnYRefLine is set, then this resource fills the curve below the Y reference line with the given color. Default: None
gsnBoxMargin This resource specifies the margin (in NDC coordinates) that you want to leave around your plot, if gsnMaximize is set to True and your output is going to an X11 window or an NCGM. Default: 0.02
gsnCenterString For any gsn_csm plotting routine, this resource adds the given string just above the plot's upper boundary and centers it. See other gsnLeftStringXXXX or gsnStringXXXX resources for ways to customize this string. Default: none
gsnCenterStringFontColor If gsnCenterString is set, this resource controls the font color of the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFontColor. 1.1 and later. Default: foreground (1)
gsnCenterStringFontHeightF If gsnCenterString is set, this resource controls the font height of the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFontHeightF. Default: dynamic
gsnCenterStringFuncCode If gsnCenterString is set, this resource sets the function code for the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFuncCode. Default: ~
gsnCenterStringOrthogonalPosF If gsnCenterString is set, this resource allows you to move this string up or down. Use small negative or positive values to nudge the string closer to or away from the plot boundary. Default: dynamic
gsnCenterStringParallelPosF If gsnCenterString is set, this resource allows you to move this string left or right. A value of 0.0 moves the plot to the left boundary of the plot, and a value of 1.0 moves it to the right boundary. A value of 0.5 (the default) centers it. Default: 0.5
gsnContourLineThicknessesScale This resource, recognized by any gsn contour drawing routine, allows you to set line thickness scale factors for all contour lines. For example, aq value of 2.0 will make the lines twice as thick. If this is set to an array that is not large enough to handle all contour lines, then the default value of 1.0 will be used for the remaining contour lines. This resource can be used in conjunction with the resource gsnContourZeroLineThicknessF. Default: none
gsnContourNegLineDashPattern This resource, recognized by any gsn contour drawing routine, allows you to select a dash pattern to use for contour lines that fall below the value 0.0. Use a value between 1 and 16 to get a dash pattern. All other contour lines will b e set to solid, unless gsnContourPosLineDashPattern is set. Default: 0 (solid line)
gsnContourPosLineDashPattern This resource, recognized by any gsn contour drawing routine, allows you to select a dash pattern to use for contour lines that fall above the value 0.0. Use a value between 1 and 16 to get a dash pattern. All other contour lines will b e set to solid, unless gsnContourNegLineDashPattern is set. Default: 0 (solid line)
gsnContourZeroLineThicknessF This resource, recognized by any gsn contour drawing routine, allows you to set a line thickness scale factor for the zero contour line. A value of 2.0 will make the line twice as thick. If you want to change the thicknesses of the non-zero lines, you can use the related resource gsnContourLineThicknessesScale. Default: 1.0
gsnDebugWriteFileName If you are having problems with a gsn_xxxxx plotting script (like gsn_csm_contour) and want to report it to an NCL developer, then set this resource to a string and rerun your script. This will cause three files to be written: 1) a netCDF file containing the data being passed to your plotting function and all the plot resources (and their values) that you set in your script, 2) a new NCL script that generates the same plot as your original script, using data and plot resource values stored in the new netCDF file, and 3) a resource file. The files will be called xxxx.nc, xxxx.ncl, and xxxx.res, respectively where xxxx is the value you set this resource to. The intention of this resource is to help users so they don't have don't have to send us their full script and data when they want to report a plotting problem to us. 3.1 and later. Default: None
gsnDraw This resource is recognized by all gsn functions that draw graphics. If set to False, then the graphics in question will not be drawn when the gsn function is called. See also gsnFrame. Default: True
gsnFrame This resource is recognized by all gsn functions that have a frame advance. If set to False, then the frame will not be advanced when the gsn function is called. See also gsnDraw. Default: True
gsnHistogramBarColors This resource allows you to specify colors for each bar in a histogram. You can use named color, index color, or RGB/A colors. If you have two sets of bars, then you can input a 2 x nbars array of indexed or named colors, a 2 x nbars x 3 array of RGB values, or a 2 x nbars x 4 array of RGBA values. Using RGBA values allows you to use transparency if desired. Default: dynamic
gsnHistogramBarWidthPercent This resource allows you to specify the width of the histogram bars as a percentage of the width of the bin that it falls in. The values must be in the range 0 to 100, and they must be smaller for comparison histograms. Default: 66% (66.0) for single histograms, and 50% (50.) for dual histograms.
gsnHistogramBinIntervals By default, gsn_histogram will pick the bin intervals for you, using either a set number of bins or a bin width. If you set this resource, then it will use these values for the bin class intervals. For example, to bin values between 1 and 2, 2 and 5, and 5 and 7, you would set gsnHistogramBinIntervals to (/1,2,5,7/). The values will be binned as follows:   1 <= bin_1 <  2    2 <= bin_2 <  5   5 <= bin_3 <= 7 To specify a discrete value rather than a range, list the value twice. For example, to bin values between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and then count all values exactly equal to 4 and exactly equal to 5, you would set gsnHistogramBinIntervals to (/1,2,3,4,4,5,5/). Note: no value will get counted twice. In the above example, values would be binned as follows:   1 <= bin_1 < 2   2 <= bin_2 < 3    3 <= bin_3 < 4    bin_3 = 4   bin_4 = 5 Default: N/A
gsnHistogramBinMissing If this resource is set to True, then when gsn_histogram is called, an extra bar will be included that counts the number of missing values in the data. Default: False
gsnHistogramBinWidth This resource allows you to set a bin width for class intervals when you call gsn_histogram. Depending on whether gsnHistogramSelectNiceIntervals is set to True, you will either get exactly bins of this size, or approximately this size. This resource does not work with the other histogram resources. Default: N/A
gsnHistogramClassIntervals Same as gsnHistogramBinIntervals. Default: N/A
gsnHistogramCompare If set to True, then two sets of histograms will be compared when you call gsn_histogram. Setting this resource to True requires that the first dimension of your input data be 2 (where index '0' represents the first field, and '1' represents the second field). Default: False
gsnHistogramComputePercentages If set to True, then percentage values will be calculated and put on the right axis (or top axis for a horizontal plot) when you call gsn_histogram. The default behavior is that missing values are not discarded in the percentage calculation. Thus, if you have 1000 values with 100 values missing and 100 values in bin "A", then the percentage calculation for bin "A" will be 10% (100/1000). If you don't want missing values included in the calculation, then set gsnHistogramComputePercentagesNoMissing to True. Default: False
gsnHistogramComputePercentagesNoMissing If this resource is set to True, then percentage values will be added to the right (or top) axis, and missing values won't be included in the percentage calculation when you call gsn_histogram. For example, if you have 1000 values with 100 of them missing, and 100 of them in bin "A", then the percentage calculation for bin "A" will be 11.1% (100/900) if this resource is True. Otherwise, the calculation will be 10% (100/1000). Note that if this resource is set to True, and you are comparing two datasets (gsnHistogramCompare = True), then both sets of data must either have no missing values, or exactly the same number of missing values. Otherwise, it won't make sense to have a percentage calculation. This resource will be forced to False if this situation arises. Default: False
gsnHistogramDiscreteBinValues By default, gsn_histogram will bin your data into bin intervals when you call gsn_histogram. If you set this resource, then your data is assumed to be already "binned", and it just counts the number of values exactly equal to the discrete values. Default: N/A
gsnHistogramDiscreteClassValues Same as gsnHistogramDiscreteBinValues. Default: N/A
gsnHistogramHorizontal If this resource is set to True when you call gsn_histogram, then the histogram bars will be drawn horizontally. Default: False
gsnHistogramMinMaxBinsOn If you set this resource to True when you call gsn_histogram, then two extra bins will be added: one that indicates all the values less than the smallest bin, and one that indicates all the values greater than the largest bin. This resource can only be used when gsnHistogramBinIntervals or gsnHistogramClassIntervals are set. For example, if gsnHistogramBinIntervals is set to (/1,2,5,7/), then the values will be binned as follows:        bin_1 <  1   1 <= bin_2 <= 2    2 <  bin_3 <= 5   5 <  bin_4 <= 7   7 <  bin_5 Default: False
gsnHistogramNumberOfBins Indicates number of bin intervals you want when you call gsn_histogram. Depending on whether gsnHistogramSelectNiceIntervals is set to True, you will either get exactly this many bins, or approximately this many bins. Default: 10
gsnHistogramPercentSign If gsnHistogramComputePercentages is set to True when you call gsn_histogram, then the right axis (top axis if doing a horizontal histogram) tickmark labels will contain the "%" symbol, instead of having "Percent" spelled out. Default: False
gsnHistogramSelectNiceIntervals Indicates whether "nice" values should be selected for the bin intervals when you call gsn_histogram. Default: True
gsnLeftString For any gsn_csm plotting routine, this resource adds the given string just above the plot's upper boundary and left-justifies it. See other gsnLeftStringXXXX or gsnStringXXXX resources for ways to customize this string. Default: data@long_name
gsnLeftStringFontColor If gsnLeftString is set, this resource controls the font color of the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFontColor. 1.1 and later. Default: foreground (1)
gsnLeftStringFontHeightF If gsnLeftString is set, this resource controls the font height of the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFontHeightF. Default: dynamic
gsnLeftStringFuncCode If gsnLeftString is set, this resource sets the function code for the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFuncCode. Default: ~
gsnLeftStringOrthogonalPosF If gsnLeftString is set, this resource allows you to move this string up or down. Use small negative or positive values to nudge the string closer to or away from the plot boundary. Default: dynamic
gsnLeftStringParallelPosF If gsnLeftString is set, this resource allows you to move this string left or right. A value of 0.0 (the default) moves the plot to the left boundary of the plot, and a value of 1.0 moves it to the right boundary. A value of 0.5 centers it. Default: 0.0
gsnLeftXRefLineBarColors If gsnXRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what colors to use in filling the bars to the left of the given X reference line. The colors will repeat if there are fewer colors than bars. Default: None
gsnLeftXRefLineBarFillScales If gsnXRefLine is set, gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and gsnLeftXRefLineBarPatterns is set, then this resource indicates what fill scales to use for the fill patterns. Values less than 1.0 give you a more dense pattern. Default: 1.0
gsnLeftXRefLineBarPatterns If gsnXRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what patterns to use in filling the bars to the left of the given X reference line. The gsnXYBarChartPatterns resource will be ignored. The patterns will repeat if there are fewer patterns than bars. Default: 0 (solid fill)
gsnLeftXRefLineColor If gsnXRefLine is set, then this resource fills the curve to the left of the X reference line with the given color. Default: None
gsnMajorLatSpacing Used to indicate the latitude spacing to use for major tickmarks and their labels in any gsn_csm routine that is generating a cylindrical equidistant map and contains a latitude axis. Default: dynamic
gsnMajorLonSpacing Used to indicate the longitude spacing to use for major tickmarks and their labels in any gsn_csm routine that is generating a cylindrical equidistant map and contains a longitude axis. Default: dynamic
gsnMaskLambertConformal When set to True, turns on masking of a lambert conformal projection. Extent of mask is determined by the four resources mpMinLonF , mpMaxLonF, mpMinLatF, mpMaxLatF. This resource is only recognized by gsn_csm routines in which data is being overlaid on a lambert conformal projection (i.e. by calling one of the gsn_csm_xxxx_map routines and setting mpProjection to "LambertConformal"). Default: False
gsnMaskLambertConformalOutlineOn If gsnMaskLambertConformal is set to True, then this resource indicates whether a border should be drawn around the masked plot. Default: True
gsnMaximize If set to True, then any plot drawn by a gsn function will be maximized in the workstation on which it is being drawn. For an X11 window or an NCGM file, this means the plot will be expanded to fill the biggest possible space within a square, with a small margin around all edges. You can get rid of this margin by setting gsnBoxMargin to 0.0. The aspect ratio will be preserved. For a PostScript or PDF file, the plot will be expanded to fill the biggest possible space on an 8 1/2" x 11" sheet of paper. For a PS or PDF file, you can change the default paper size, margins, or orientation with the resources gsnPaperOrientation, gsnPaperMargin, gsnPaperWidth, and gsnPaperHeight. Note: in NCL version 5.2.0, you can use better resources: wkPaperSize or wkPaperWidthF / wkPaperHeightF for setting the paper size, or the width and height. These resources can only be set when you call gsn_open_wks. Default: False
gsnMinorLatSpacing Used to indicate the latitude spacing to use for minor tickmarks and their labels in any gsn_csm routine that is generating a cylindrical equidistant map and contains a latitude axis. Default: dynamic
gsnMinorLonSpacing Used to indicate the longitude spacing to use for minor tickmarks and their labels in any gsn_csm routine that is generating a cylindrical equidistant map and contains a longitude axis. Default: dynamic
gsnPanelBottom By default, the gsn_panel routine places all of the plots in the largest area possible in the viewport. This resource, which must be a value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0, allows you to set a limit for where the bottommost plot(s) can be drawn. This allows you to reserve white space at the bottom for something like a labelbar. See also the other gsnPanel* resources. Default: 0.0
gsnPanelCenter By default, the gsn_panel routine centers all of the plots that it is paneling. If there are not enough plots to fill up the requested number of rows and columns, then it will center the remaining plots in the last row. If you set this resource to False, then the remaining plots will be left-justified. Default: True
gsnPanelDebug If you set this resource to True for the gsn_panel routine, then you will get some verbose information printed to the screen about what viewport coordinates are being used for the panelled plots. This information is useful if you want to panel the plots yourself, and you want some viewport values to start with. Default: False
gsnPanelFigureStrings If you set this gsn_panel resource to a list of strings, these strings will be used as figure strings in the lower right hand corner of each paneled plot. You can set the resource amJust to change the location of the figure strings. ("TopRight", "TopLeft", or "BottomLeft" are the other choices.) Default: none
gsnPanelFigureStringsBackgroundFillColor If you set gsnPanelFigureStrings in a call to gsn_panel, then this resource allows you to control the background fill color of the box that surrounds each figure string. Default: 0 (background color)
gsnPanelFigureStringsFontHeightF If you set gsnPanelFigureStrings in a call to gsn_panel, then this resource allows you to control the font height of the figure strings. If you don't set this resource, then the font height is calculated internally based on a number of factors. Default: dynamic
gsnPanelFigureStringsJust If you set gsnPanelFigureStrings in a call to gsn_panel, then this resource allows you to control the location of the figure strings. The default is the bottom right of each plot. You can also specify "TopRight", "TopLeft", etc. This resource replaces the awkwardly named "amJust" resource that was previously used (this resource will still work, for backwards compatibility, but this new one will take precedence). Default: "BottomRight"
gsnPanelFigureStringsPerimOn If you set gsnPanelFigureStrings in a call to gsn_panel, then this resource turns on the drawing of a box perimeter around each figure string. Default: False
gsnPanelLabelBar If you set this gsn_panel resource to True, then a single labelbar will be generated for all the plots on the page. The default is to draw the labelbar on the bottom, unless lbOrientation is set to "Vertical". Note: using this resource assumes that all of your plots have the same labelbar! Default: False
gsnPanelLeft By default, the gsn_panel routine tries to place all of the plots in the largest area possible in the viewport. This resource, which must be a value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0, allows you to set a limit for where the leftmost plot(s) can be drawn. This allows you to reserve white space at the left for something like a labelbar. See also the other gsnPanel* resources. Default: 0.0
gsnPanelMainFont Sets the font for the gsnPanelMainString title. This resource replaces the awkwardly named "txFont" resource that was previously used (this resource will still work, for backwards compatibility, but this new one will take precedence). Default: "helvetica"
gsnPanelMainFontColor Sets the font color for the gsnPanelMainString title. This resource replaces the awkwardly named "txFontColor" resource that was previously used (this resource will still work, for backwards compatibility, but this new one will take precedence). Default: "black"
gsnPanelMainFontHeightF Sets the font height for the gsnPanelMainString title. This resource replaces the awkwardly named "txFontHeightF" resource that was previously used (this resource will still work, for backwards compatibility, but this new one will take precedence). Default: dynamic
gsnPanelMainPosXF Sets the X location of the justification point for the panel main title in NDC coordinates. Default: <dynamic> 
gsnPanelMainPosYF Sets the Y location of the justification point for the panel main title in NDC coordinates. Default: <dynamic> 
gsnPanelMainString Creates a main title for paneled plots generated by gsn_panel. This resource replaces the awkwardly named "txString" resource that was previously used (this resource will still work, for backwards compatibility, but this new one will take precedence). Default: ""
gsnPanelRight By default, the gsn_panel routine tries to place all of the plots in the largest area possible in the viewport. This resource, which must be a value greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, allows you to set a limit for where the rightmost plot(s) can be drawn. This allows you to reserve white space at the right for something like a labelbar. See also the other gsnPanel* resources. Default: 1.0
gsnPanelRowSpec By default, the gsn_panel routine panels its plots according to the dims variable which indicates rows x columns. If you set gsnPanelRowSpec to True, however, then you can use the dims variable to indicate the number of plots you want per row. For example, setting gsnPanelRowSpec to True and dims to (/2,3,1/) will put 2 plots in the first row, 3 plots in the second row, and 1 plot in the third row. Default: False
gsnPanelScalePlotIndex By default, the gsn_panel routine uses the first valid plot in its list to determine the scale factor for resizing all of the plots to be paneled. If your plots are slightly different sizes, you can use this resource to indicate the index of which plot should be used to determine the scale factor. This is especially useful if your first valid plot is smaller than one or more of the others in the list. Default: 0 or the id of the first valid plot in the list
gsnPanelTop By default, the gsn_panel routine tries to place all of the plots in the largest area possible in the viewport. This resource, which must be a value greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 1.0, allows you to set a limit for where the topmost plot(s) can be drawn. This allows you to reserve white space at the top for something like a title. See also the other gsnPanel* resources. Default: 1.0
gsnPanelXF The gsn_panel routine calculates the NDC X and Y positions of the upper left corner of every plot on the panel. If you want to tweak any of the X positions, then you can set the gsnPanelXF resource to an array of the same length as the number of plots you want to panel, and give it the new NDC coordinates you want for the X positions. If you want to keep any of the calculated values that gsn_panel uses, then set the corresponding gsnPanelXF value to a negative value. You can set gsnPanelDebug to True to find out what values are being used for the X and Y positions. Default: None
gsnPanelXWhiteSpacePercent Takes a percentage value from 0 to 100 to indicate what percentage of the total plot width should be used for white space at the left and right of each plot in a call to gsn_panel. See also the other gsnPanel* resources. Default: 1.0
gsnPanelYF The gsn_panel routine calculates the NDC X and Y positions of the upper left corner of every plot on the panel. If you want to tweak any of the Y positions, then you can set the gsnPanelYF resource to an array of the same length as the number of plots you want to panel, and give it the new NDC coordinates you want for the Y positions. If you want to keep any of the calculated values that gsn_panel uses, then set the corresponding gsnPanelYF value to a negative value. You can set gsnPanelDebug to True to find out what values are being used for the X and Y positions. Default: None
gsnPanelYWhiteSpacePercent Takes a percentage value from 0 to 100 to indicate what percentage of the total plot height should be used for white space at the top and bottom of each plot in a call to gsn_panel. See also the other gsnPanel* resources. Default: 1.0
gsnPaperHeight This resource specifies the height (in inches) of the paper that you plan to print the PostScript or PDF file on. This resource only comes into effect if gsnMaximize is set to True. See also gsnPaperMargin, gsnPaperWidth, and gsnPaperOrientation. Note: in NCL version 5.2.0, you can use better resources: wkPaperSize or wkPaperWidthF / wkPaperHeightF for setting the paper size, or the width and height. These resources can only be set when you call gsn_open_wks. Default: 11.0
gsnPaperMargin This resource specifies the margin (in inches) that you want to leave around the plotting area if gsnMaximize is set to True and your output is going to a PS, EPS, EPSI, or PDF file. See also gsnPaperHeight, gsnPaperWidth, and gsnPaperOrientation. If your output is X11 or NCGM, then you can use gsnBoxMargin to control the margin size. Default: 0.5
gsnPaperOrientation This resource specifies the orientation of the plot on paper that you plan to print the PostScript or PDF file on. This resource only comes into effect if gsnMaximize is set to True. Valid values are "portrait", "landscape", and "auto". If set to "auto", then NCL will figure out the best possible orientation to use for the type of plot being drawn. You cannot change the orientation after you already begin drawing to a frame. If you are not using gsnMaximize, then to control the orientation you can check out the wkOrientation resource. Default: "auto"
gsnPaperWidth This resource specifies the width (in inches) of the paper that you plan to print the PostScript or PDF file on. This resource only comes into effect if gsnMaximize is set to True. See also gsnPaperMargin, gsnPaperHeight, and gsnPaperOrientation. Note: in NCL version 5.2.0, you can use better resources: wkPaperSize or wkPaperWidthF / wkPaperHeightF for setting the paper size, or the width and height. These resources can only be set when you call gsn_open_wks. Default: 8.5
gsnPolar Controls what polar hemisphere is shown on polar sterographic plots generated by gsn_csm_xxxx_polar routines. Set to either "SH" or "NH" Default: "NH"
gsnPolarLabelDistance If one of the gsn_csm_xxxx_polar routines is called, this resource applies a scale to apply to the distance (in NDC coordinates) of the polar longitude labels from the map perimeter. A value of 1.0 will cause the labels to be right up against the perimeter. Default: 1.04, which represents a 4% increase in the distance.
gsnPolarLabelFont If one of the gsn_csm_xxxx_polar routines is called, this resource controls the font of the polar labels. Default: dynamic
gsnPolarLabelFontHeightF If one of the gsn_csm_xxxx_polar routines is called, this resource controls the font height of the polar lat/lon labels. Recall that these labels are special labels added by the template, and are not true tick mark labels. Default: dynamic
gsnPolarLabelSpacing If one of the gsn_csm_xxxx_polar routines is called, this resource sets the longitude spacing for the longitude labels. Default: 30 or whatever mpGridLonSpacingF is set to.
gsnPolarTime If this resource is set to True, then instead of getting longitude labels on polar sterographic plots generated by gsn_csm_xxxx_polar, you will get local time. Default: False
gsnPolarUT If gsnPolarTime is set to True, then this resource can be set to some value such that the local time axis is shifted in such a way that 0 LT is always at the bottom of the plot. For example, if gsnPolarUT is set to 12 UT, then the whole field is shifted by 180 degrees Default: 0
gsnRightString For any gsn_csm plotting routine, this resource adds the given string just above the plot's upper boundary and right-justifies it. See other gsnRightStringXXXX or gsnStringXXXX resources for ways to customize this string. Default: data@units
gsnRightStringFontColor If gsnRightString is set, this resource controls the font color of the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFontColor. 1.1 and later. Default: foreground (1)
gsnRightStringFontHeightF If gsnRightString is set, this resource controls the font height of the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFontHeightF. Default: dynamic
gsnRightStringFuncCode If gsnRightString is set, this resource sets the function code for the string. This resource overrides gsnStringFuncCode. Default: ~
gsnRightStringOrthogonalPosF If gsnRightString is set, this resource allows you to move this string up or down. Use small negative or positive values to nudge the string closer to or away from the plot boundary. Default: dynamic
gsnRightStringParallelPosF If gsnRightString is set, this resource allows you to move this string left or right. A value of 0.0 moves the plot to the left boundary of the plot, and a value of 1.0 (the default) moves it to the right boundary. A value of 0.5 centers it. Default: 1.0
gsnRightXRefLineBarColors If gsnXRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what colors to use in filling the bars to the right of the given X reference line. The colors will repeat if there are fewer colors than bars. Default: None
gsnRightXRefLineBarFillScales If gsnXRefLine is set, gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and gsnRightXRefLineBarPatterns is set, then this resource indicates what fill scales to use for the fill patterns. Values less than 1.0 give you a more dense pattern. Default: 1.0
gsnRightXRefLineBarPatterns If gsnXRefLine is set and gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource indicates what patterns to use in filling the bars to the right of the given X reference line. The gsnXYBarChartPatterns resource will be ignored. The patterns will repeat if there are fewer patterns than bars. Default: 0 (solid fill)
gsnRightXRefLineColor If gsnXRefLine is set, then this resource fills the curve to the right of the X reference line with the given color. Default: None
gsnScalarContour If set to True when calling any gsn_csm vector/contour routine, the third field will be drawn as a separate contour field. Otherwise, the vectors will be colored according to the third field. Default: False
gsnScale If set to True, then the X and Y axis labels will be scaled to be the same size and the tick marks will be scaled to be the same length in any gsn function that creates tickmarks. This is useful when the X and Y axis are of different lengths, but you still want the labels and tick marks to be the same for each axis. See also gsnShape. Default: False
gsnShape If set to True in any non-map gsn function that has an X and Y axis, then whichever axis has the smaller range will be resized so that the ratio of the axes ranges is the same as the ratio of the axes lengths. For example, if the Y axis ranges from 1 to 50, and the X axis ranges from 1 to 100, then setting gsnShape to True will cause the Y axis to be resized to half the length of the X axis. If this resource is set to True, then gsnScale is also automatically set to True. Default: False
gsnSpreadColorEnd This resource only takes effect if gsnSpreadColors is set to True. It indicates the index of the last color in the color table that should be used for a color contour or vector plot. If this value is negative, then the value indicates the position from the last color in the color table. For example, -1 indicates the last color, -2 indicates the second to the last color, and so on. (The colors go from 0 to ncol-1, where ncol is the number of colors.) See also gsnSpreadColorStart. If gsnSpreadColorStart and gsnSpreadColorEnd are selected such that the start color is after the end color in the color table, then the colors will be reversed. Default: -1
gsnSpreadColorStart This resource only takes effect if gsnSpreadColors is set to True. It indicates the index of the first color in the color table that should be used for a color contour or vector plot. If this value is negative, then the value indicates the position from the last color in the color table. For example, -1 indicates the last color, -2 indicates the second to the last color, and so on. (The colors go from 0 to ncol-1, where ncol is the number of colors.) See also gsnSpreadColorEnd. If gsnSpreadColorStart and gsnSpreadColorEnd are selected such that the start color is after the end color in the color table, then the colors will be reversed. Default: 2
gsnSpreadColors In NCL version 6.this resource is superceded by the use of new resources cnSpanFillPalette, vcSpanLevelPalette, and stSpanLevelPalette. For backwards compatibility, if gsnSpreadColorStart is set to something other than 2, and/or gsnSpreadColorEnd is set to something other than -1, *and* you haven't set gsnSpreadColors to False, then the xxSpanxxxPalette resources will be ignored, and your color map will be spanned according to the index values indicated by gsnSpreadColorStart and gsnSpreadColorEnd. Otherwise, in NCL V6.0.0 and earlier, if this resource is set to True when calling any gsn function that produces vectors and/or contours, then the colors used will be spread across the whole color map. See also gsnSpreadColorStart and gsnSpreadColorEnd. Default: deprecated in V6.1.0 and higher (False in V6.0.0 and earlier)
gsnStringFont If any of gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, or gsnRightString are set, this resource controls the font of these strings. Default: dynamic
gsnStringFontColor If any of gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, or gsnRightString are set, this resource controls the font color of these strings. You can use gsnLeftStringFontColor, gsnCenterStringFontColor, or gsnRightStringFontColor to control the individual colors of each string. 1.1 and later. Default: foreground (1)
gsnStringFontHeightF If any of gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, or gsnRightString are set, then this resource controls the font height of these strings. This resource can be overridden by setting the individual resources gsnLeftStringFontHeightF, gsnRightStringFontHeightF, or gsnCenterStringFontHeightF. Default: dynamic
gsnStringFuncCode If any of gsnLeftString, gsnCenterString, or gsnRightString are set, then this resource sets the function code for these strings. This resource can be overridden by setting the individual resources gsnLeftStringFuncCode, gsnRightStringFuncCode, or gsnCenterStringFuncCode. Default: ~
gsnTickMarksOn If set to False, then no tickmarks or tickmark labels will be drawn in the gsn functions where tickmarks are drawn automatically. This also works for the polar map plots that have longitude labels drawn around the circumference. Default: True
gsnXAxisIrregular2Linear If set to True, then the X axis will be linearized for any contour, vector, or streamline plot created by a gsn function. This resource should only be set to True if coordinate arrays are being used to define your X axis values, and they are not linear. Default: False
gsnXAxisIrregular2Log If set to True, then the X axis will be changed to log scaling for any contour, vector, or streamline plot created by a gsn function. This resource should only be set to True if coordinate arrays are being used to define your X axis values, and they are not linear. Otherwise, you can just use the trXLog resource to indicate you want log scaling. Default: False
gsnXRefLine Draws a vertical line at the given X value in the gsn_csm_xy function. Default: None
gsnXRefLineColor If gsnXRefLine is set, this resource indicates the color of the line. Default: 1 (foreground color)
gsnXRefLineColors If gsnXRefLine is set to multiple reference lines, this resource indicates the color of each line. Default: 1 (foreground color)
gsnXRefLineDashPattern If gsnXRefLine is set, this resource indicates the dash pattern of the line. Default: 0 (solid line)
gsnXRefLineDashPatterns If gsnXRefLine is set to multiple reference lines, this resource indicates the dash pattern of each line. Default: 0 (solid lines)
gsnXRefLineThicknessF If gsnXRefLine is set, this resource indicates a scale factor for the thickness of the line. A value of 2.0 doubles the thickness. Default: 1.0
gsnXRefLineThicknesses If gsnXRefLine is set to multiple reference lines, this resource indicates a scale factor for the thickness of each line. A value of 2.0 doubles the thickness. Default: 1.0
gsnXYAboveFillColors This resource can be used to indicate a fill color to use between two curves in an XY plot that intersect. It only applies to the gsn_csm_xy function. It should be set to an array of colors that has one fewer values than you have curves. This resource was updated in NCL V6.4.0 to allow for RGB/A color. The first value will be used to fill all areas between the first and second curves where the values in the first curve are greater (in the Y direction) than the values in the second curve. The second value will be used to fill all areas between the second and third curves where the values in the second curve are greater than the values in the third curve, and so on. If you set this resource to less than ncurves-1 colors, then the colors will be repeated as necessary. If the Y axis is reversed, then this resource is a bit misleading because now the "above" curves will be reverted. To indicate that you don't want any fill, use either "transparent" or the value -1. To fill areas where values in one curve are less than values in another curve, use gsnXYBelowFillColors. If you want to fill between two curves that do not intersect, see gsnXYFillColors. Default: None
gsnXYBarChart If set to True, this will turn an gsn_csm_xy line plot into a vertical bar chart, where each bar is an individual Y value. As of 4.0 and later., if you set gsnXRefLine, then you will get a horizontal bar chart. Default: False
gsnXYBarChartBarWidth If gsnXYBarChart is set, then this resource allows the user to control the width of the bars. By default, the width of the bars is the distance between each X or Y value (dx or dy). To get a bar width that is half the default, then, use a value of dx/2 (dy/2). If you have multiple curves, then you can set an array of bar widths, one for each curve. Default: dynamic 
gsnXYBarChartColors If gsnXYBarChart is set, then this resource controls the colors of individual bars for charts without a reference line. Default: None
gsnXYBarChartColors2 If gsnXYBarChart is set, then this resource controls the colors of individual bars and assigns the colors consecutively, regardless of whether the bar is up or down for vertical bar plots, or left or right for horizontal bar plots. Default: None
gsnXYBarChartFillDotSizeF If gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and the bars are filled with the stipple dot fill pattern, then this resource allows you to increase the dot size. The default value of 0.0 causes the dots to be drawn as before, using a workstation dependent minimum dot size. A caveat is that individual dots are not clipped around the edges of fill areas; this becomes more noticeable as the dot size increases. Default: 0.0 
gsnXYBarChartFillLineThicknessF If gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and the bars are filled with a non-solid pattern, then this resource controls the thickness of the lines in the fill pattern. Default: 1.0
gsnXYBarChartFillOpacityF If gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and the bars are filled with a solid color, then this resource indicates what fill opacity value to use for the fill colors. Values closer to 0 give you less opacity, and values close to 1.0 give you more opacity. Default: 1.0
gsnXYBarChartFillScaleF If gsnXYBarChart is set to True, and the bars are filled with a non-solid pattern, then this resource indicates what fill scale to use for the fill pattern. Values less than 1.0 give you a more dense pattern. Default: 1.0
gsnXYBarChartOutlineOnly If gsnXYBarChart is set, then setting this resource to True indicates you want an outline of the bars, and not each individual bar outlined. Default: False
gsnXYBarChartOutlineThicknessF If gsnXYBarChart is set to True, then this resource controls the thickness of the bar outlines. 2.1 and later. Default: 1.0
gsnXYBarChartPatterns If gsnXYBarChart is set, then this resource controls the patterns of individual bars for charts w/o a reference line. Default: None
gsnXYBarChartPatterns2 If gsnXYBarChart is set, then this resource controls the patterns of individual bars and assigns the patterns consecutively regardless of whether the bar is up or down for vertical bar plots, or left or right for horizontal bar plots. Default: None
gsnXYBelowFillColors This resource can be used to indicate a fill color to use between two curves in an XY plot that intersect. It only applies to the gsn_csm_xy function. It should be set to an array of colors that has one fewer values than you have curves. This resource was updated in NCL V6.4.0 to allow for RGB/A color. The first value will be used to fill all areas between the first and second curves where values in the first curve are less (in the Y direction) than values in the second curve. The second value will be used to fill all areas between the second and third curves where values in the second curve are less than values in the third curve, and so on. If you set this resource to less than ncurves-1 colors, then the colors will be repeated as necessary. If the Y axis is reversed, then this resource is a bit misleading because now the "below" curves will be reverted. To indicate that you don't want any fill, use either "transparent" or the value -1. To fill areas where values in one curve are greater than values in another curve, use gsnXYAboveFillColors. If you want to fill between two curves that do not intersect, see gsnXYFillColors. Default: None
gsnXYFillColors This resource can be used to indicate a fill color to use between two adjacent curves in an XY plot. It only applies to the gsn_csm_xy function. It should be set to an array of colors that has one fewer values than you have curves. This resource was updated in NCL V6.4.0 to allow for RGB/A color. The first value will be used to fill the area between the first and second curves, the second value will be used to fill the area between the second and third curves, and so on. If you set this resource to less than ncurves-1 colors, then the colors will be repeated as necessary. To indicate that you don't want any fill, use either "transparent" or the value -1. If you want to fill between two curves that intersect, see gsnXYAboveFillColors and gsnXYBelowFillColors. Default: None
gsnXYFillOpacities This resource can be used to indicate opacity values to use for filled curves that overlap when you set gsnXYFillColors. It should be an array of values between 0.0 and 1.0. Note: there's a bug in V6.2.0 that causes this resource to not work if you only have gsnXYBelowFillColors set. To work around this issue, you need to set gsnXYAboveFillColors to an array of the same size as gsnXYBelowFillColors, but just set it to all -1 or "transparent" so it doesn't have any effect. Default: 1.0
gsnXYLeftFillColors This resource can be used to indicate a fill color to use between two curves in an XY plot that intersect. It only applies to the gsn_csm_xy function. It should be set to an array of colors that has one fewer values than you have curves. This resource was updated in NCL V6.4.0 to allow for RGB/A color. The first value will be used to fill all areas between the first and second curves where values in the first curve are less than values in the second curve. The second value will be used to fill all areas between the second and third curves where values in the second curve are less than values in the third curve, and so on. If you set this resource to less than ncurves-1 colors, then the colors will be repeated as necessary. To indicate that you don't want any fill, use either "transparent" or the value -1. To fill areas where values in one curve are greater than values in another, use gsnXYRightFillColors. If you want to fill between two curves that do not intersect, see gsnXYFillColors. Default: None
gsnXYRightFillColors This resource can be used to indicate a fill color to use between two curves in an XY plot that intersect. It only applies to the gsn_csm_xy function. It should be set to an array of colors that has one fewer values than you have curves. This resource was updated in NCL V6.4.0 to allow for RGB/A color. The first value will be used to fill all areas between the first and second curves where values in the first curve are greater (in the X direction) than values in the second curve. The second value will be used to fill all areas between the second and third curves where values in the second curve are greater than values in the third curve, and so on. If you set this resource to less than ncurves-1 colors, then the colors will be repeated as necessary. To indicate that you don't want any fill, use either "transparent" or the value -1. To fill areas where values in one curve are less than values in another, use gsnXYLeftFillColors. If you want to fill between two curves that do not intersect, see gsnXYFillColors. Default: None
gsnYAxisIrregular2Linear If set to True, then the Y axis will be linearized for any contour, vector, or streamline plot created by a gsn function. This resource should only be set to True if coordinate arrays are being used to define your Y axis values, and they are not linear. Default: False
gsnYAxisIrregular2Log If set to True, then the Y axis will be changed to log scaling for any contour, vector, or streamline plot created by a gsn function. This resource should only be set to True if coordinate arrays are being used to define your Y axis values, and they are not linear. Otherwise, you can just use the trYLog resource to indicate you want log scaling. Default: False
gsnYRefLine Draws a horizontal line at the given Y value in the gsn_csm_xy function. Default: None
gsnYRefLineColor If gsnYRefLine is set, this resource indicates the color of the line. Default: 1 (foreground color)
gsnYRefLineColors If gsnYRefLine is set to multiple reference lines, this resource indicates the color of each line. Default: 1 (foreground color)
gsnYRefLineDashPattern If gsnYRefLine is set, this resource indicates the dash pattern of the line. Default: 0 (solid line)
gsnYRefLineDashPatterns If gsnYRefLine is set to multiple reference lines, this resource indicates the dash pattern of each line. Default: 0 (solid line)
gsnYRefLineThicknessF If gsnYRefLine is set, this resource indicates a scale factor for the thickness of the line. A value of 2.0 doubles the thickness. Default: 1.0
gsnYRefLineThicknesses If gsnYRefLine is set to multiple reference lines, this resource indicates a scale factor for the thickness of each line. A value of 2.0 doubles the thickness. Default: 1.0
gsnZonalMean If set to True, then a zonal mean plot is drawn on the right side of a contour/map plot generated by one of the gsn_csm_contour_map_ce or gsn_csm_contour_map routines (it will not work with polar plots). For versions version 5.0.0 and earlier, this resource only works with cylindrical equidstant projections. Default: False
gsnZonalMeanXMaxF If gsnZonalMean is set to True, then this resource allows the user to set the maximum value of the X axis of the attached zonal mean plot. Default: dynamic
gsnZonalMeanXMinF If gsnZonalMean is set to True, then this resource allows the user to set the minimum value of the X axis of the attached zonal mean plot. Default: dynamic
gsnZonalMeanYRefLine If gsnZonalMean is set to True, then this resource draws a horizontal line at the given value. Default: dynamic
lbAutoManage The lbAutoManage switch determines how LabelBar operates; when True, LabelBar manages the sizing of the title and the label text. The title is always sized to fit within the currently set boundaries of the LabelBar given any text angle, aspect ratio, etc. The labels also are sized to fit within the current boundary. Additionally, the sizing of the labels is managed so that under any rotation, the labels will not overlap. Also the label justification is managed such that, given any rotation, the end of the label string aligns with the correct LabelBar box. When off, you may directly size the labels and text as you please. However, under rotation, the justification of the labels does not change, and, although the text is moved out of the way of the LabelBar boxes, it will not necessarily line up correctly. In practice, when working interactively, a good method is to create a basic LabelBar layout close to the desired size with the lbAutoManage mode on, then switch it off to tune the text size precisely to your taste. Currently, when the text of the labels is rotated, the size of the LabelBar may increase slightly along the axis of orientation. Default: True 
lbBottomMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever LabelBar axis is smallest, between the bottommost LabelBar element and the bottom edge of the LabelBar perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current LabelBar extent. Negative values are allowed. Default: 0.05 
lbBoxCount Number of boxes in the labelbar. All the LabelBar array resources, when specified, are required to have a number of elements related to the number of boxes. The arrays specified by lbFillPatterns, lbFillColors, and lbFillScales must have at least as many elements as the box count. The minimum size of the lbLabelStrings array may be the box count, one element less than box count, or one element more than box count, depending on the setting of the lbLabelAlignment resource. The lbBoxFractions array, when set, always requires one element more than box count. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: 16 
lbBoxEndCapStyle This resource controls the shape of the two outer boxes of the LabelBar, which may be either rectangular (like the interior boxes) or triangular/arrow shaped. Set it to one of these four values: RectangleEnds TriangleLowEnd TriangleHighEnd TriangleBothEnds Default: RectangleEnds NOTE: this resource should be ignored if the contour resource cnLabelBarEndStyle is set to "ExcludeOuterBoxes". 
lbBoxFractions An array that specifies sizing of each box in the LabelBar when the box sizing mode is set to ExplicitSizing. There must be one more element in this array than the number of items specified by the resource lbBoxCount. Each element of the array must eventually contain a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, with succeeding elements increasing monotonically. The first element must be 0.0 and the last 1.0. If invalid values are discovered when the array is checked, it is not considered an error. Instead, the code simply supplies linearly interpolated values for all adjacent elements containing out- of-bounds elements. The interpolation is performed relative to the two closest bounding elements containing valid values, or 0.0 or 1.0 respectively if the first or last element contains invalid data. The values thus obtained represent the beginnings and endings of the LabelBar boxes. Default: NULL 
lbBoxLineColor The hlu index of the color used to draw lines around the boxes in the LabelBar Default: Foreground 
lbBoxLineDashPattern The hlu index of the dash pattern used for the lines around the boxes of the LabelBar. Default: 0 
lbBoxLineDashSegLenF The length in NDC units of the dash pattern used for the lines around the boxes of the LabelBar. Default: 0.15 
lbBoxLineThicknessF Determines the thickness of the lines used around the boxes. Default: 1.0 
lbBoxLinesOn A boolean flag determining whether lines should appear around the boxes in the LabelBar. Default: True 
lbBoxMajorExtentF Determines the amount of the area allotted to each box of the LabelBar in the direction of lbOrientation is actually occupied by the box. When set to 1.0, the boxes touch each other. If set to 0.0, the boxes disappear entirely. Intermediate values create separated boxes. Default: 1.0 
lbBoxMinorExtentF When the lbAutoManage feature is turned on, this resource determines the fraction of the distance (less the margins) across the axis perpendicular to the orientation (the minor axis) occupied by the boxes of the LabelBar. If set to 1.0, the boxes entirely crowd out their associated labels. If lbTitlePosition is set to a side parallel with the major axis, the lbBoxMinorExtentF cannot exceed 1.0 minus the amount of space used for the title, as set by the resource lbTitleExtentF. When lbAutoManage is False and lbTitlePosition is set to a side perpendicular to the major axis, the axis extent from which the box minor extent is calculated includes any extra extent added due to an increased value given to lbTitleFontHeightF. However, it does not include extra extent due to increased value given to the lbLabelFontHeightF resource. Default: 0.33 
lbBoxSeparatorLinesOn If this resource is set to False, it will draw a labelbar with no interior box lines (box separator lines), and just a perimeter line around the "bar" of the labelbar. Default: True 
lbBoxSizing When set to UniformSizing, all the boxes in the LabelBar have the same size. When set to ExplicitSizing, the values in the array, lbBoxFractions, determine the relative size of each box along the major axis (the axis of orientation). Default: UniformSizing 
lbFillBackground The color index used for the background of all the boxes in the LabelBar. By default it is set to Transparent (-1), specifying that the background of the boxes is transparent to whatever it overlays. Note that the box background is only observable when the fill pattern is not solid. This resource also applies to the background of the fill pattern set with the lbPerimFill resource. Default: Transparent 
lbFillColor When lbMonoFillColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets a uniform fill color for all the LabelBar boxes. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: Foreground 
lbFillColors This array resource of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray individually sets the color of each box in the LabelBar when lbMonoFillColor is set False. The LabelBar ensures that this array contains at least as many elements as the current value of lbBoxCount. You may cause a box to appear empty by setting the appropriate array element to the value Transparent. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: By default, each box is assigned to the next succeeding color in the hlu color table, up to the number of defined colors. Additional boxes are assigned the current value of wkForegroundColor. 
lbFillDotSizeF This resource sets a uniform dot size, in NDC units, for the stipple dot fill pattern. The default value of 0.0 causes the dots to be drawn as before, using a workstation dependent minimum dot size. A caveat is that individual dots are not clipped around the edges of fill areas; this becomes more noticeable as the dot size increases. Default: 0.0 
lbFillLineThicknessF The line thickness used for the lines that comprise the fill pattern within the label boxes. Default: 1.0 
lbFillOpacityF This resource is intended for those who explicitly create labelbars, as opposed to the labelbars that are created automatically by a ContoutPlot. It is ignored in the case of automatically created LabelBars. Generally the opacity of automatic LabelBars mirrors the opacity of the colors used in the ContourPlot, although it is possible to override this via lbOverrideFillOpacity. Valid values are real-numbers between 0.0 (completely transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
lbFillPattern When lbMonoFillPattern is set True, this resource of type NhlTFillIndex sets a uniform fill pattern for all the LabelBar boxes. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: SolidFill 
lbFillPatterns This array resource of type NhlTFillIndexGenArray individually sets the fill pattern of each box in the LabelBar when lbMonoFillPattern is set False. The LabelBar ensures that this array contains at least as many elements as the current value of lbBoxCount. You can cause any box to appear empty by setting the appropriate array element to the value HollowFill (-1). Note that you can use the scalar resource lbFillBackground to set a uniform solid-fill background color the fill patterns. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: All array elements above those specified by the user are assigned values according to the formula: element_index MOD wkFillTableLength + 1. 
lbFillScaleF When lbMonoFillScale is set True, lbFillScaleF sets a uniform fill scale that applies to all patterns in the LabelBar boxes. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: 1.0 
lbFillScales When lbMonoFillScale is False, each element of this array resource contains an individual scale value that is applied to the pattern assigned to the corresponding box in the LabelBar. When the scale value is 1.0, all lines in the currently defined patterns are nominally spaced at about 0.01 NDC units. The scale value is applied as a factor to this spacing. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: 1.0 for all elements 
lbJustification When the labelbar changes size, the justification determines a fixed point about which the size change occurs. Any of the corners, the center of any edge, or the current center of the LabelBar may be set to the fixed justification point. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: BottomLeft 
lbLabelAlignment How the labels align with respect to the labelbar boxes. If set to BoxCenters, the labels align with the centers of each box, and the number of labels is equal to the number of boxes. If set to InteriorEdges, the labels align with the internal separators between the boxes, and there is one fewer label than the number of boxes. If set to ExternalEdges, the labels align with the external edges as well as the interior separators between the boxes, and there is one more label than boxes. The default for this resource is InteriorEdges when used with a contour, vector, or streamline plot, because the labelbar colors represent colors between levels. If you set this resource to BoxCenters or ExternalEdges, then NCL will use your contour, vector, or streamline levels to label the boxes, but they likely won't be correct. You must supply the correct labels and the extra labels required, by setting lbLabelStrings to the desired array of labels. If you don't, then the extra labels will be set to "Labels_xx". This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: InteriorEdges when used with a contour, vector, or streamline plot, and BoxCenters when creating a labelbar from scratch. 
lbLabelAngleF The angle of the text of the labels. When the auto-manage resource is turned on, both the size and justification mode of the label text may change in response to changes of the label angle. Default: 0.0 
lbLabelAutoStride When this boolean resource is set True, LabelBar labels are checked for overlap before being drawn. If overlap would otherwise occur, a stride is set through the labels such that overlap will be avoided. The stride proceeds in both directions from a pivot label, chosen based on how "round" it is relative to the other labels. If the labels seem to be equally "round" or if the labels are non-numeric, then the shortest label is chosen as the pivot. If lbLabelAlignment is set to ExternalEdges, the behavior is a bit different. In this case, the stride is set as described above, but the labels at each end are guaranteed to appear. This may cause labels that would otherwise be part of the stride sequence to be eliminated. This behavior is useful when the end labels are used to show the extreme values of a dataset. The stride calculated as a result of setting lbLabelAutoStride is independent of the stride specified by the lbLabelStride resource and is applied subsequently to it. Also note that lbAutoManage must be set False in order for lbLabelAutoStride to have an effect. When lbAutoManage is True, the label font height is reduced to avoid overlap and therefore a stride greater than unity is never required. Default: False (will default to True in V6.
lbLabelBarOn A boolean flag that determines whether the LabelBar should appear. Primarily useful as a forwarded resource when the LabelBar is a child of a higher level object. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: True 
lbLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when lbLabelFontQuality is set to High, theLabelBar writes line label text with proportional spacing. Setting the lbLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior and instead begins each character a distance of lbLabelConstantSpacingF times the nominal character size from the beginning of the previous character. This implies that values between 0.0 and 1.0 will cause the characters to overlap each other, while a value of 1.0 implies no space between two nominally sized characters. This parameter is ignored when lbLabelFontQuality is not Low or Medium. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
lbLabelDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the label text. Default: Across 
lbLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the LabelBar labels. Default: "pwritx" 
lbLabelFontAspectF Determines the shape of the label font text. Values greater than 1.0 make the text tall and skinny. Values less than one make the text short and wide. Default: 1.0 
lbLabelFontColor The hlu color index used for drawing the label text. Default: Foreground 
lbLabelFontHeightF The height in NDC coordinates of the text used to draw the labels. When lbAutoManage is set True, the user cannot directly set the label font height. Rather, it is set in response to other factors, such as the current size and shape of the LabelBar, the current setting of lbBoxMinorExtentF, the current text angle of the labels, and how much space there is between the labels. Set lbAutoManage False if you wish to control the label font height directly. Default: 0.02 
lbLabelFontQuality Determines the text quality used to draw the label text. Default: High 
lbLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw the Label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the lbLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
lbLabelFuncCode Determines the function code character used when parsing the label string. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
lbLabelJust The justification of the label text. When the auto-manage feature is on, the justification may be changed internally in response to changes in the label angle. Therefore in order to control the label justification explicitly, you must first turn off the auto-manage feature. Default: CenterCenter 
lbLabelOffsetF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of the length of the minor labelbar axis (perpendicular to the axis of orientation), between the LabelBar boxes and the labels. Default: 0.1 
lbLabelPosition This resource of type NhlTPosition determines the position of the labels with respect to the LabelBar boxes. If the orientation of the LabelBar is Horizontal, valid values are Top, Center, and Bottom. If the orientation is Vertical, valid values are Left, Center, and Right. If a value inappropriate for the orientation is assigned, the value is silently converted as follows: Bottom becomes Left, Top becomes Right, and vice versa. When set to Center the labels are centered on, and when the auto-manage feature is on, sized to fit within, each respective label box. Default: Right 
lbLabelStride Determines which labels actually are rendered the LabelBar is drawn. For example, if the stride is set to 2, only every other label will be drawn, starting with the first label. Default: 1 
lbLabelStrings An array containing the strings comprising each label in the LabelBar. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot (see cnExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn)     VectorPlot (see vcExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn)     StreamlinePlot (see stExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn)  Default: Label_<label element number> 
lbLabelsOn A boolean flag determining whether labels should appear in the LabelBar. Default: True 
lbLeftMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever LabelBar axis is smallest, between the leftmost LabelBar element and the left edge of the LabelBar perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current LabelBar extent. Negative values are allowed. Default: 0.05 
lbMaxLabelLenF This read-only resource returns the maximum length in NDC of the strings used as LabelBar labels. Default: <dynamic> 
lbMinLabelSpacingF This read-only resource returns the minimum distance in NDC from the start of one label string to the start of the next label string. Default: <dynamic> 
lbMonoFillColor When set True, all LabelBar boxes are set to a single color, as specified by the value of the scalar resource lbFillColor. When False, the elements of the array resource lbFillColors control the color of each box individually. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: False 
lbMonoFillPattern When set True, all the boxes in the labelbar are set to a single pattern, as specified by the value of the scalar resource lbFillPattern. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: False 
lbMonoFillScale When set True, the patterns applied to each box in the LabelBar are scaled by a single factor, as specified by the value the scalar resource lbFillScaleF. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     VectorPlot     StreamlinePlot  Default: True 
lbOrientation This resource of type NhlTOrientation specifies whether the labelbar boxes are arranged horizontally in a row or vertically in a column. The major axis of the LabelBar instance is parallel to the orientation and the minor axis is perpendicular to the orientation. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: Vertical 
lbOverrideFillOpacity In the case of LabelBars created automatically by a ContourPlot, by default the opacity of the LabelBar mirrors the opacity of the fill-colors of the ContourPlot. Setting this resource to True causes the resultant LabelBar to be fully opaque, regardless of the ContourPlot fill-colors. Default: False 
lbPerimColor The hlu index of the color used for the line around the perimeter of LabelBar. Default: Foreground 
lbPerimDashPattern Specifies the hlu index of the dash pattern used to draw the perimeter of the LabelBar. Default: 0, specifying a solid line 
lbPerimDashSegLenF The length in NDC units of the dash pattern used to draw the perimeter of the LabelBar. Default: 0.15 
lbPerimFill The hlu index of the pattern used to fill the background of the LabelBar area. Only has an effect when the lbPerimFillColor has set to a value greater than Transparent (-1). Default: HollowFill 
lbPerimFillColor The hlu index of the color used to fill the background of the Legend area. Only has an effect when the lbPerimFill has a value greater than HollowFill (-1). Default: Background 
lbPerimOn A boolean flag determining whether a line is drawn around the perimeter of the LabelBar. Default: True 
lbPerimThicknessF Specifies the thickness of the line used to draw the perimeter of the LabelBar. Default: 1.0 
lbRasterFillOn If set True, this resource causes the LabelBar to use raster mode fill rather than normal polygon fill to render the box colors. In this case, only solid fill is possible; the fill pattern resources are ignored. If any element of lbFillColors is set to Transparent or lbBoxSizing is set to ExplicitSizing, raster mode fill is not possible: LabelBar issues a warning and defaults to normal polygon fill. Normally, assuming the boxes are solid-filled, the appearance of the LabelBar boxes will be identical whether or not this resource is set. It only makes a difference when the output must go to certain printers that render colors slightly differently when raster fill is in effect. ContourPlot forces lbRasterFillOn to True when it manages a LabelBar and raster fill is in effect. Default: False 
lbRightMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever LabelBar axis is smallest, between the rightmost LabelBar element and the right edge of the LabelBar perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current LabelBar extent. Negative values are allowed. Default: 0.05 
lbTitleAngleF The angle of the title text. When the auto-manage feature is on, the title size changes as the text rotates. Default: 0.0 
lbTitleConstantSpacingF Determines a constant amount of extra space that is placed between each character of the title text. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
lbTitleDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the title text. When the title position, as set by the resource lbTitlePosition, is Top or Bottom the direction is set by default to Across. When title position is Left or Right the text is set by default to Down. Default: Across 
lbTitleExtentF The LabelBar title occupies a rectangular portion of the LabelBar viewport bounded on three sides by edges of the viewport and on the fourth by a line determined by the value of this resource. lbTitleExtentF specifies a fraction of the length (minus the margins) of the LabelBar axis perpendicular to lbTitlePosition. At this point along the length of the axis the fourth side of the title extent rectangle is constructed parallel to the side specified by lbTitlePosition. The sum of the values given to lbTitleExtentF and lbTitleOffsetF cannot exceed 0.5 (half the length of the axis). If the sum does exceed 0.5, a warning is issued and both values are reset to their default values. If lbAutoManage is set False, and lbTitleFontHeightF is set such that the title extent rectangle cannot accommodate the full extent of the title text, the viewport of the LabelBar instance is expanded to fit the title text extent. However, the LabelBar treats this additional extent as 'extra'. The title extent rectangle does not change its size as long as the LabelBar view width or height is not explicitly modified. This means that as you set lbTitleFontHeightF to smaller values, the LabelBar viewport will shrink until its size matches the size it would have had if the text extent fit within the originally set title extent. Default: 0.15 
lbTitleFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the LabelBar title. Default: "pwritx" 
lbTitleFontAspectF Determines the shape of the title font text. Values greater than 1.0 make the text tall and skinny. Values less than one make the text short and wide. Default: 1.0 
lbTitleFontColor The hlu index of the color used for the title text. Default: Foreground 
lbTitleFontHeightF The font height in NDC units used for the title text. If lbAutoManage is set True, the LabelBar sets this resource automatically based on the space available and the value of other title font attributes including lbTitleAngleF, lbTitleConstantSpacingF and lbTitleFontAspectF. The available space is determined from the size of the LabelBar viewport and the setting of the resource lbTitleExtentF. When lbAutoManage is True, attempts by the user to set this resource are simply ignored. If lbAutoManage is False, the LabelBar instance will honor the set value of lbTitleFontHeightF, even if it must increase the size of the viewport in order to encompass the full extent of the title text. However, space added in this manner is considered an addition to the 'fundamental' size of the LabelBar. If the lbTitleFontHeightF is reduced to a value less than or equal to the value that would be used if lbAutoManage were True, then the LabelBar will resize itself to its 'fundamental' size. If you resize the LabelBar by setting the width or height of its viewport, lbTitleFontHeightF and the 'fundamental' size both adjust themselves proportionally. Default: 0.025 
lbTitleFontQuality Determines the text quality used to draw the title text. Default: High 
lbTitleFontThicknessF Determines the thickness of the line used to draw the Label text. This resource only affects the Hershey fonts. Default: 1.0 
lbTitleFuncCode Determines the function code character used when parsing the label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
lbTitleJust The justification used for the title text. Default: CenterCenter 
lbTitleOffsetF This resource defines an offset specified as a fraction of the length of the axis (minus the margins) perpendicular to the side specified by lbTitlePosition. This offset separates the title extent, as specified by lbTitleExtentF, from the other elements of the LabelBar. Default: 0.03 
lbTitleOn A boolean flag determining whether the title should appear in the LabelBar. If lbTitleString is set when the LabelBar object created, lbTitleOn defaults to True. Otherwise it defaults to False. Default: True 
lbTitlePosition This resource of type NhlTPosition determines the position of the title with respect to the other elements of the LabelBar. Valid positions are Top, Bottom, Left, and Right. When you set the title position, LabelBar automatically adjusts the title direction, unless you explicitly set lbTitleDirectionin the same call. When you set the position to Top or Bottom, the title direction is set to Across; when the position is set to Left or Right, the title direction is set to Down. Default: Top 
lbTitleString A string containing the text used for the LabelBar title. If lbTitleString is set when the LabelBar object created, the boolean resource lbTitleOn defaults to True, causing the title to appear. Otherwise it defaults to False. If you explicitly set lbTitleOn True without setting lbTitleString, LabelBar supplies a title consisting of the name of the current instantiation of the object. Default: <dynamic> 
lbTopMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever LabelBar axis is smallest, between the topmost LabelBar element and the top edge of the LabelBar perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current LabelBar extent. Negative values are allowed. Default: 0.05 
lgAutoManage The lgAutoManage switch determines how Legend operates. When it is on, Legend manages the sizing of the title and the label text. The title is always sized to fit within the currently set boundaries of the Legend given any text angle, aspect ratio, etc. The labels also are sized to fit within the current boundary, with the exception that when the text of the labels is rotated, the Legend as a whole may grow along the axis of orientation. Additionally the sizing of the labels is managed so that under any rotation, the labels will not overlap. Also the label justification is managed such that, given any rotation the end of the label string aligns with the correct Legend item. When off, you may directly size the labels and text as you please. However, under rotation, the justification of the labels does not change, and, although the text is moved out of the way of the Legend boxes, it will not necessarily line up correctly. In practice, when working interactively, a good method is to create a basic Legend layout close to the desired size with the lgAutoManage mode on, then switch it off to tune the text size precisely to your taste. Default: True 
lgBottomMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever Legend axis is smallest, between the rightmost Legend element and the right edge of the Legend perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current Legend extent. Default: 0.05 
lgBoxBackground The color index used for the background of the boxes enclosing the Legend items. By default it is set to -1 (Transparent), specifying that the background of the boxes is transparent to whatever it overlays. Default:Transparent 
lgBoxLineColor The hlu index of the color used to draw the box lines around the Legend items. Default: Foreground 
lgBoxLineDashPattern The hlu index of the dash pattern used for the lines drawn around the Legend items. Default: Solidline 
lgBoxLineDashSegLenF The length in NDC units of the dash pattern used for the box lines around the Legend items. Default: 0.15 
lgBoxLineThicknessF Determines the thickness of the box lines drawn around the Legend items. Default: 1.0 
lgBoxLinesOn A boolean flag determining whether boxes should appear around Legend items. Default: False 
lgBoxMajorExtentF Determines the amount of the area allotted to the boxes surrounding each item of the Legend in the direction of lgOrientation is actually occupied by the box. This will be visible only when the boxes outlining the space occupied by each item are turned on. When set to 1.0 the boxes touch each other. If set to 0.0 the boxes disappear entirely. Intermediate values create discreet separated boxes. The items themselves are not affected by the value given to lgBoxMajorExtentF. Default: 0.5 
lgBoxMinorExtentF When the lgAutoManage feature is turned on, this resource determines the fraction of the distance (less the margins) across the axis perpendicular to the orientation (the minor axis) occupied by the boxes surrounding the each item of the Legend. If set to 1.0, the explanatory labels are completely eliminated from the Legend area. If the title also extends along the minor axis, the lgBoxMinorExtentF cannot exceed 1.0 minus the amount of space requested by the title, as set by the resource lgTitleExtentF. The value of the lgBoxMinorExtentF controls how long a line segment is when the item type is set to Lines, but it does not clip or affect the appearance of item type Markers in any way. When lgAutoManage is False and lgTitlePosition is set to a side perpendicular to the major axis, the axis extent from which the box minor extent is calculated includes any extra extent added due to an increased value given to lgTitleFontHeightF. However, it does not include extra extent due to increased value given to the lgLabelFontHeightF resource. Default: 0.6 
lgDashIndex When lgMonoDashIndex is set True, this resource sets a uniform dash pattern index for the lines drawn in all items in the legend. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: SolidLine 
lgDashIndexes When lgMonoDashIndex is set False, this array sets a dash pattern index value for each Legend item individually. If a positive index greater than the number of dash patterns is specified, the dash pattern routines automatically use modular arithmetic to arrive at an index value within the defined range of indexes. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: Array elements 0 through the item count - 1 are assigned indexes 1 through item count. 
lgItemCount Number of items in the Legend. All the Legend array resources, when specified, are required to have at least as many elements as lgItemCount. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: 16 
lgItemOrder This resource allows you to control the order of the items in the Legend. It must be set as an array of lgItemCount integers containing the values 0 through item count - 1, ordered as you wish the items to appear. For example, to reverse the order of a Legend with 4 items, you would set the resource with the array (/ 3, 2, 1, 0 /). If the array contains too many or too few elements, repeated values, or any values outside the valid range, the resource will be ignored and a warning message emitted. Default: NULL 
lgItemPlacement When set to UniformPlacement all Legend items are evenly spaced within the Legend. If set to ExplicitPlacement, the distance between each item is controlled by the lgItemPositions array. Default: UniformPlacement 
lgItemPositions When lgItemPlacement is set to ExplicitPlacement, the elements of this array control the relative position within the Legend of each item. The array should be a monotonically increasing sequence in the range 0.0 - 1.0 inclusive (except as noted below). Each element corresponds to the position of the Legend item with the corresponding index. The value indicates the distance of each particular item from the left or bottom (depending on the value of lgOrientation) of the Legend item area. A value of 1.0 indicates the right or top of the item area, while 0.5 would indicate the center of the item area. You can cause a subgroup of the items to be evenly spaced by giving the value -1.0 to the elements between two elements containing valid monotonically increasing values. The Legend object will replace the -1.0 values with monotonically increasing values evenly spaced between the two given valid values. Actually it will replace any invalid values in the same manner, although values other than -1.0 will cause a WARNING error. Default: NULL 
lgItemType When lgMonoItemType is set True, this resource sets all the items in the legend. It indicates if they should contain a line, a marker, or both. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: Lines 
lgItemTypes When lgMonoItemType is set False, this array sets an NhlTMarkLineMode value for each Legend item individually. This means that each item in the Legend can have a line, a marker, or both based on the value of each element of this array. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: NULL 
lgJustification When the Legend changes size the justification determines a fixed point about which the size change occurs. Any of the corners, the center of any edge, or the current center of the Legend may be set to be the fixed justification point. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: BottomLeft 
lgLabelAlignment How the labels align with respect their corresponding items along the minor axis of the Legend object. When set to ItemCenters, the labels align with the centers of each item. If set to AboveItems, the labels appear above the item, while if set to BelowItems, the labels appear below the item. To avoid overlap use alignment modes of above or below when the label offset is negative or the label position is set to Center. Default: ItemCenters 
lgLabelAngleF The angle of the text of the labels. When the auto-manage resource is turned on, both the size and justification mode of the label text may change in response to changes of the label angle. Default: 0.0 
lgLabelAutoStride When this boolean resource is set True, Legend labels are checked for overlap before being drawn. If overlap would otherwise occur, a stride is set through the labels such that overlap will be avoided. The stride proceeds in both directions from a pivot label, chosen based on how "round" it is relative to the other labels. If the labels seem to be equally "round" or if the labels are non-numeric, then the shortest label is chosen as the pivot. The stride calculated as a result of setting lgLabelAutoStride is independent of the stride specified by the lgLabelStride resource and is applied subsequently to it. Also note that lgAutoManage must be set False in order to see the effect of setting lgLabelAutoStride True. When lgAutoManage is True, the label font height is reduced to avoid overlap and therefore a stride greater than unity is never required. Default: False 
lgLabelConstantSpacingF Determines a constant amount of extra space that is placed between each character of the label text. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
lgLabelDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the label text. Default: Across 
lgLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the Legend labels. Default: "pwritx" 
lgLabelFontAspectF Determines the shape of the label font text. Values greater than 1.0 make the text tall and skinny. Values less than one make the text short and wide. Default: 1.0 
lgLabelFontColor The hlu color index used for drawing the label text. Default: Foreground 
lgLabelFontHeightF The height in NDC coordinates of the text used to draw the labels. When lgAutoManage is set True, the user cannot directly set the label font height. Rather it is set in response to other factors, such as the current size and shape of the Legend, the current setting of lgBoxMinorExtentF, the current text angle of the labels, and how much space there is between the labels. Set lgAutoManage False if you wish to control the label font height directly. Default: 0.02 
lgLabelFontQuality Determines the text quality used to draw the label text. Default: High 
lgLabelFontThicknessF Determines the thickness of the line used to draw the Label text. This resource only affects the Hershey fonts. Default: 1.0 
lgLabelFuncCode Determines the function code character used when parsing the label string. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot  Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
lgLabelJust The justification of the label text. When the auto-manage feature is on, the Legend object manages the justification internally. Therefore in order to control the label justification explicitly you must first turn off the auto-manage feature. Default: CenterCenter 
lgLabelOffsetF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of the length of the minor Legend axis (perpendicular to the axis of orientation), between the Legend boxes and the labels. The offset may be positive or negative and the offset direction depends on the current value of lgLabelJust. The positive direction is from the justified edge toward the body of the text (i.e. positive for right-justified text is toward the left). The primary use of negative offsets for labels is when the label alignment is set either to AboveBoxes or BelowBoxes. In these cases, you may begin or end the text at some point under or over the Legend items, thus allowing for more text within a narrower Legend. If the label alignment is set to BoxCenters, negative offsets may result in text appearing overlaid on the actual Legend items. When positive the label offset quantity is subtracted from the amount allotted to the labels as a whole. Default: 0.02 
lgLabelPosition This resource of type NhlTPosition determines the position of the labels with respect to the Legend boxes. If the orientation of the Legend is Horizontal, valid values are Top, Center, and Bottom. If the orientation is Vertical, valid values are Left, Center, and Right. If a value inappropriate for the orientation is assigned, the value is silently converted as follows: Bottom becomes Left, Top becomes Right, and vice versa. When set to Center the labels are centered on, and when the auto-manage feature is on, sized to fit in the same space as each Legend item. To avoid overlap, the lgLabelAlignment resource must be set properly when the label position is Center. Default: Right 
lgLabelStride Determines which labels actually are rendered the Legend is drawn. For example, if the stride is set to 2, only every other label will be drawn, starting with the first label. Default: 1 
lgLabelStrings An array containing the strings that comprise the label associated with each item of the Legend. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot  Default: Label_<label element number> 
lgLabelsOn A boolean flag determining whether labels should appear in the Legend. Default: True 
lgLeftMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever Legend axis is smallest, between the leftmost Legend element and the left edge of the Legend perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current Legend extent. Default: 0.05 
lgLegendOn A boolean flag that determines whether the Legend should appear. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: True 
lgLineColor When lgMonoLineColor is True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets the color of each Legend item line to a single value. Note that color of the line labels are controlled by a different set of resources. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: Foreground 
lgLineColors When lgMonoLineColor is False, this resource of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray individually sets the color assigned to each Legend item line. Note that color of the line labels are controlled by a different set of resources. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: By default each item line is assigned to the next succeeding color in the hlu colortable, up to the number of defined colors. Additional boxes are assigned the value, "Foreground" (1).

lgLineLabelFontColor When lgMonoLineLabelFontColor is True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets the color of all line labels used in line type items to a single value. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: 
lgLineLabelFontColors When lgMonoLineLabelFontColor is False, this resource of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray individually sets the color index used to render the line label for each line type Legend item. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: NULL 
lgLineLabelFontHeightF When lgMonoLineLabelFontHeight is True, this resource sets the height in NDC units of all the internal line labels used for line type items. Note that unlike many other text font height type resources, the values of this resource does not automatically scale when the size of the Legend is changed. This is because the size may be of significance in distinguishing the items for which the Legend serves as the key. Also, note that setting lgAutoManage True does not disable lgLineLabelFontHeightF. The Legend object currently does nothing to prevent the internal line labels from overlapping other Legend items, when the value of this resource is large enough. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: 0.01 
lgLineLabelFontHeights When lgMonoLineLabelFontHeight is False, the elements of this array individually specify the height in NDC units of the internal line labels used with line type items. Note that unlike many other text font height type resources, the values of this resource does not automatically scale when the size of the Legend is changed. This is because the size may be of significance in distinguishing the items for which the Legend serves as the key. Also, note that setting lgAutoManage True does not disable lgLineLabelFontHeights. The Legend object currently does nothing to prevent the internal line labels from overlapping other Legend items, when the value of this resource is large enough. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: NULL 
lgLineLabelFontQuality Determines the text quality used to draw the line label text. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: High 
lgLineLabelFontThicknessF Determines the thickness of the line used to draw the internal line label text. This resource only affects the Hershey fonts. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: 1.0 
lgLineLabelFuncCode Determines the function code character used when parsing the line label string. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
lgLineLabelStrings An array of strings. Each string determines the contents of the label used in the rendering of the line specified by the corresponding element in the lgDashIndexes resource, if the corresponding element in the lgItemTypes resource indicates "Lines". To have an item line without a line label, specify that element with NULL using the C interface, or an empty string ("") from FORTRAN or NCL. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: NULL 
lgLineLabelsOn A boolean flag determining whether to draw line labels in line type Legend items. Default: True 
lgLineThicknessF When lgMonoLineThickness is True, this resource sets a singles thickness value for all Legend item lines.

lgMarkerColors When lgMonoMarkerColor is False, this resource of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray individually sets the color assigned to each Legend item marker. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: By default each item marker is assigned to the next succeeding color in the hlu colortable, up to the number of defined colors. Additional boxes are assigned the value, "Foreground" (1). 
lgMarkerIndex When lgMonoMarkerIndex is set True, this resource sets a uniform marker for all items in the legend. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: 
lgMarkerIndexes When lgMonoMarkerIndex is set False, this array sets a marker index value for each Legend item individually. If a positive index greater than the number of markers is specified, the marker routines automatically use modular arithmetic to arrive at an index value within the defined range of indexes. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: Array elements 0 through the item count - 1 are assigned indexes 1 through item count. 
lgMarkerSizeF When lgMonoMarkerSize is True, this resource sets the height in NDC units of all marker items. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: 0.01

lgMonoDashIndex When set True, the scalar resource lgDashIndex sets the dash pattern index for all lines drawn in items in the legend to a single index value. Otherwise, the array resource lgDashIndexes controls the dash index of each legend item individually. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: False 
lgMonoItemType When set True, the scalar resource lgItemType sets all items in the legend to the same NhlTMarkLineMode. This indicates if the item should contain a line, a marker, or both. Otherwise, the array resource lgItemTypes controls each legend item individually. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: True 
lgMonoLineColor When set True, all item lines in the Legend are set to a single color, as specified by the value of the scalar resource lgLineColor. Otherwise, the array resource lgLineColors controls the color of each item line individually. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: False

lgMonoLineThickness When set True, a single line thickness is used for all item lines in the Legend object, as specified by the scalar resource lgLineThicknessF. Otherwise the array element of lgLineThicknesses controls the thickness of each individual Legend item line. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: True 
lgMonoMarkerColor When set True, all items markers in the Legend are set to a single color, as specified by the value of the scalar resource lgMarkerColor. Otherwise, the array resource lgMarkerColors controls the color of each item marker individually. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: False 
lgMonoMarkerIndex When set True, the scalar resource lgMarkerIndex sets the marker index for all lines drawn in items in the legend to a single index value. Otherwise, the array resource lgMarkerIndexes controls the marker index of each legend item individually. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: False 
lgMonoMarkerSize When set True, the size of all marker type items is set to a single size, as specified by the scalar resource lgMarkerSizeF. Otherwise, the size is individually controlled by the array resource lgMarkerSizes. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: True

Otherwise the array elements of lgMarkerThicknesses controls the thickness of each individual Legend marker. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     XyPlot  Default: True 
lgOrientation This resource of type NhlTOrientation specifies whether the legend items are arranged horizontally in a row or vertically in a column. The major axis of the Legend instance is parallel to the orientation and the minor axis is perpendicular to the orientation. Default: Vertical 
lgPerimColor The hlu index of the color used for the perimeter line. Default: Foreground 
lgPerimDashPattern Specifies the hlu index of the dash pattern used to draw the perimeter of the Legend. Default: SolidLine 
lgPerimDashSegLenF The length in NDC units of the dash pattern used to draw the perimeter of the Legend. Default: 0.15 
lgPerimFill The hlu index of the pattern used to fill the background of the Legend area. Only has an effect when the lgPerimFillColor has set to a value greater than NhlTRANSPARENT (-1). Default: HollowFill 
lgPerimFillColor The hlu index of the color used to fill the background of the Legend area. Only has an effect when the lgPerimFill has a value greater than HollowFill (-1). Default: Background 
lgPerimOn A boolean flag determining whether to draw a line around the perimeter of the Legend. Default: True 
lgPerimThicknessF Specifies the thickness of the perimeter line. Default: 1.0 
lgRightMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever Legend axis is smallest, between the rightmost Legend element and the right edge of the Legend perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current Legend extent. Default: 0.05 
lgTitleAngleF The angle of the title text. When the auto-manage feature is on, the title size changes as the text rotates. Default: 0.0 
lgTitleConstantSpacingF Determines a constant amount of extra space that is placed between each character of the title text. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
lgTitleDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the title text. When the title position, as set by the resource lgTitlePosition, is Top or Bottom the direction is set by default to Across. When title position is Left or Right the text is set by default to Down. Default: Across 
lgTitleExtentF The Legend title occupies a rectangular portion of the Legend viewport bounded on three sides by edges of the viewport and on the fourth by a line determined by the value of this resource. lgTitleExtentF specifies a fraction of the length (minus the margins) of the Legend axis perpendicular to lgTitlePosition. At this point along the length of the axis the fourth side of the title extent rectangle is constructed parallel to the side specified by lgTitlePosition. The sum of the values given to lgTitleExtentF and lgTitleOffsetF cannot exceed 0.5 (half the length of the axis). If the sum does exceed 0.5, a warning is issued and both values are reset to their default values. If lgAutoManage is set False, and lgTitleFontHeightF is set such that the title extent rectangle cannot accommodate the full extent of the title text, the viewport of the Legend instance is expanded to fit the title text extent. However, the Legend treats this additional extent as 'extra'. The title extent rectangle does not change its size as long as the Legend view width or height is not explicitly modified. This means that as you set lgTitleFontHeightF to smaller values, the Legend viewport will shrink until its size matches the size it would have had if the text extent fit within the originally set title extent. Default: 0.15 
lgTitleFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the Legend title. Default: "pwritx" 
lgTitleFontAspectF Determines the shape of the title font text. Values greater than 1.0 make the text tall and skinny. Values less than one make the text short and wide. Default: 1.0 
lgTitleFontColor The hlu index of the color used for the title text. Default: Foreground 
lgTitleFontHeightF The font height in NDC units used for the title text. If lgAutoManage is set True, the Legend sets this resource automatically based on the space available and the value of other title font attributes including lgTitleAngleF, lgTitleConstantSpacingF and lgTitleFontAspectF. The available space is determined from the size of the Legend viewport and the setting of the resource lgTitleExtentF. When lgAutoManage is True, attempts by the user to set this resource are simply ignored. If lgAutoManage is False, the Legend instance will honor the set value of lgTitleFontHeightF, even if it must increase the size of the viewport in order to encompass the full extent of the title text. However, space added in this manner is considered an addition to the 'fundamental' size of the Legend. If the lgTitleFontHeightF is reduced to a value less than or equal to the value that would be used if lgAutoManage were True, then the Legend will resize itself to its 'fundamental' size. If you resize the Legend by setting the width or height of its viewport, lgTitleFontHeightF and the 'fundamental' size both adjust themselves proportionally. Default: 0.025 
lgTitleFontQuality Determines the text quality used to draw the title text. Default: High 
lgTitleFontThicknessF Determines the thickness of the line used to draw the Label text. This resource only affects the Hershey fonts. Default: 1.0 
lgTitleFuncCode Determines the function code character when parsing the title string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
lgTitleJust The justification used for the title text. Default: CenterCenter 
lgTitleOffsetF This resource defines an offset specified as a fraction of the length of the axis (minus the margins) perpendicular to the side specified by lgTitlePosition. This offset separates the title extent, as specified by lgTitleExtentF, from the other elements of the Legend. Default: 0.03 
lgTitleOn A boolean flag determining whether the title should appear in the Legend. Default: True 
lgTitlePosition This resource of type NhlTPosition determines the position of the title with respect to the other elements of the Legend. Valid positions are Top, Bottom, Left, and Right. When you set the title position, Legend automatically adjusts the title direction, unless you explicitly set lgTitleDirection in the same call. When you set the position to Top or Bottom, the title direction is set to Across; when the position is set to Left or Right, the title direction is set to Down. Default: Top 
lgTitleString A string containing the text used for the Legend title. Default: <dynamic> The name of the Legend object is used if this resource is not set. 
lgTopMarginF Defines an offset, specified as a fraction of whichever Legend axis is smallest, between the rightmost Legend element and the right edge of the Legend perimeter. It is always subtracted from the current Legend extent. Default: 0.05 
mpAreaGroupCount (MapPlot) mpAreaGroupCount specifies the total number of area groups, including the "default" group, the three fixed (or geophysical) groups, and the dynamic (or political) groups (a minimum of six). The minimum, as well as the default, value of mpAreaGroupCount is 10. The maximum value is 255. Attempts to set mpAreaGroupCount to values outside this range result in a warning and a restoration of the default value. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 10 
mpAreaMaskingOn (MapPlot) This boolean resource is the master switch for enabling the area masking facility. If True, MapPlot enables area masking, causing areas named in the mpMaskAreaSpecifiers array to remain unfilled, consequently allowing previously drawn plot elements to be visible within the areas' outlines. If False, no masking is performed, regardless of the contents of mpMaskAreaSpecifiers. For convenience, setting mpMaskAreaSpecifiers causes mpAreaMaskingOn to be set True, if it is not explicitly set otherwise in the same call. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: False 
mpAreaNames (MapPlot) mpAreaNames is a string array resource you can use to retrieve the names of all areas in a MapPlot database. You need to know these names, including specific details of their spelling, in order to use the specifier resources (mpFillAreaSpecifiers, mpOutlineSpecifiers, or mpMaskAreaSpecifiers). There is a unique name for each distinct area. However, the form of the names differs depending on the database in use. You can also set this resource to rename the area names, perhaps to better represent the conventions of another locale. You must set the complete list of names at the same time. Keep in mind that the order of areas is fixed: a particular element of the array always refers to the same area in the database you are using regardless of the name you give it. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     All names that are compounds of several words use the hyphen character ('-') to separate the individual words. In several cases where the names would otherwise not be unique, an underscore character ('_') followed by a digit is appended to the end of the name. If you use a SetValues call to rename the areas, it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not duplicate the names of any areas. Only one of a group of identically named areas will remain accessible. See the Ncarg4_0 database table for the list of area names.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     Each geographic entity in the Ncarg4_1 database is defined in a hierarchical manner as a descendent of one of the two top level elements "Land" and "Water". Therefore each entity has a "fully-qualified" name that starts with the term "Land" or "Water". Colons separate entities that have different levels (see mpAreaTypes) and periods separate child entities that are conceptually at the same level. For example, the island of Tasmania has the fully qualified name "Land : Australia : Australia . Tasmania", where the first "Australia" is the continent and the second is the country of which Tasmania is a part. However, mpAreaNames does not return the fully-qualified name of the resource. Instead it returns only enough of the name, starting from the right, to ensure that it is unique. In this case it would be simply the string "Tasmania". If another entity named "Tasmania" existed in the dataset, it would return "Australia . Tasmania".     The Ncarg4_1 version of the database provides several different datasets, that while similar in their overall content, provide different types and levels of geographic detail. See mpDataSetName for a list of the datasets available with this database, along with links to tables of detailing their contents.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is not used and is set to NULL.  Default: <dynamic> 
mpAreaTypes (MapPlot) This read-only integer array resource contains the integer value of the type of each area in a MapPlot database. Each element gives the type of the area named by the corresponding element of the mpAreaNames array. The meaning and value of these types vary depending on the value of mpDataBaseVersion. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     Areas are classified into eight types. These types are as follows:         (0) mpOcean         (1) mpContinent         (2) mpLargeIsland         (3) mpSmallIsland         (4) mpInlandWater         (5) mpNational         (6) mpUSStateLand         (7) mpUSStateWater      See the Ncarg4_0 database table to find the area type associated with a particular area name.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     Areas are classified into four or five four types. These types represent the four or five levels of the hierarchical classification scheme currently represented in the database. More types may be added if and when areas at other levels of the hierarchy are added to the database. The current types are as follows:         (1) land or water         (2) continental boundary         (3) national boundary         (4) state or provincial boundary         (5) county boundary or climate division      Three datasets are available for this database version. Earth..1 contains only the first 4 levels, while Earth..2 and Earth..3 contain 5 levels. Use mpDataSetName to select among the possible datasets.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is not used and is set to NULL.  Default: <dynamic> 
mpBottomAngleF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Angles, this resource specifies the positive angle in degrees down from the center to the edge of the projection, or, if using a satellite projection, the displacement angle down from the satellite line of sight to the projection center. Note that direction of the line over which the angle is measured remains parallel to the left edge of the viewport, regardless of the rotation angle applied to the projection. mpBottomAngleF has a maximum allowable value that varies depending on the projection. Default: 80.0 
mpBottomMapPosF (MapTransformation) This read-only resource contains the coordinate of the bottom edge of the projected area in NDC space. Default: 0.0 
mpBottomNDCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NDC, this resource specifies the bottom edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Device Coordinates. If mpBottomNDCF is set to a value greater than mpRightNDCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. Since the relationship between the map projection area and NDC coordinates changes whenever the map limits are changed, as well as when the viewport area is moved or resized, MapTransformation resets the value of mpBottomNDCF to the NDC value of the bottom edge of the projected area at the end of any update to the transformation. Default: <dynamic> 
mpBottomNPCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NPC, this resource specifies the bottom edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Projection Coordinates. mpBottomNPCF is constrained to values in the range 0.0 through 1.0. If mpBottomNPCF is set to a value greater than mpTopNPCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. The value of mpBottomNPCF is updated whenever the map limits are set using any of the map limit modes. Default: 0.0 
mpBottomPointLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the latitude, in degrees, of a point along the bottom edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpBottomPointLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the longitude, in degrees, of a point along the bottom edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpBottomWindowF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Window, this resource specifies the value, in window coordinates, of the bottom edge of the projection. Default: 0.0 
mpCenterLatF (MapTransformation) This resource defines the latitude of the center of the map projection coordinate system. It applies for all values of the mpProjection resource except for LambertConformal. Its value must lie between -90.0 and +90.0, where -90.0 represents the South Pole and +90.0 represents the North Pole. V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 0.0 
mpCenterLonF (MapTransformation) This resource defines the longitude of the center of the map projection coordinate system. It applies for all values of the mpProjection resource except for LambertConformal. Its value must lie between -180.0 and +180.0, where both extremes represent the longitude of the International Dateline. V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 0.0 
mpCenterRotF (MapTransformation) Unless the origin lies at one of the poles, this resource defines the angle that the map projection coordinate system is rotated counterclockwise from a vector directed north with origin at the projection center. If the projection center is at the North Pole, the vector points in the direction of mpCenterLonF+180.0. If the center is the South Pole, the vector points in the direction of mpCenterLonF. mpCenterRotF applies for all values of the mpProjection resource except for LambertConformal. Default: 0.0 
mpCountyLineColor (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTColorIndex can be set using a named color string or an integer value. It specifies the color used to render interior county or climate division boundary outlines. Currently these are available within the Conterminous United States only. It has no effect on County or climate division boundary lines that are coincident with state or geographical boundaries. This resource is ignored unless mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes). Default: Foreground 
mpCountyLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the index specifying the dash pattern used to render interior county or climate division boundary outlines. Currently these are available within the Conterminous United States only. It has no effect on County or climate division boundary lines that are coincident with state or geographical boundaries. This resource is ignored unless mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes). p> Default: SolidLine 
mpCountyLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to render interior county or climate division boundary outlines. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. These boundaries are currently available within the Conterminous United States only. This resource has no effect on County or climate division boundary lines that are coincident with state or geographical boundaries. MapPlot sets the default value of mpCountyLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. This resource is ignored unless mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes). Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpCountyLineThicknessF (MapPlot) This resource Sets the thickness of the lines used to render interior county or climate division boundary outlines. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Currently these boundaries areavailable within the Conterminous United States only. This resource has no effect on County or climate division boundary lines that are coincident with state or geographical boundaries. This resource is ignored unless mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes). Default: 1.0 
mpDataBaseVersion (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTMapDataBaseVersion determines which database version MapPlot should use. Currently there are four choices: Ncarg4_0 (alias: LowRes)     Use the original database as supplied with MapPlot in version 4.0. This database is out of date with respect to political boundaries and has much lower resolution than the Ncarg4_1 database. Nevertheless, for global scale plots that involve only geophysical boundaries, this database is the recommended one to use. Because there are so many fewer points, MapPlot can render the data much faster, particularly when fill is involved. This database contains 583 named geographical entities.  Ncarg4_1 (alias: MediumRes)     Use one of the map datasets developed for the Ncarg4_1 version of the MapPlot database. These datasets contain between 1085 and 6853 geographical entities arranged in an extensible hierarchical fashion. The database is organized in such a way that new subdivisions of existing areas can easily be added. The resolution is much higher than the original database, and the political boundaries are more up-to-date. Use of this database is recommended when plotting limited areas of the earth's surface, any time up-to-date political boundaries are required, or when certain subdivisions of the United States, Canada, or Mexico are desired. Select the dataset using the resource mpDataSetName. The datasets available are:         Earth..1 (includes national and US state boundaries)         Earth..2 (includes, national, Canadian provincial, US and Mexican state, and US county boundaries)         Earth..3 (includes, national, Canadian provincial, US and Mexican state, and US climate division boundaries)         (1.0 and later.) Earth..4 (includes US, Canadian, Mexican, Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, and Australian state/provincial boundaries and US county boundaries.)  RANGS_GSHHS (aliases: HighRes, RANGS)     Use the multi-resolution coastline database RANGS (Regionally Accessible Nested Global Shorelines), developed by Rainer Feistel from Wessel and Smith's GSHHS (Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shoreline) database. This database is not supplied with the NCAR Graphics software suite, but may be freely downloaded from https://www.io-warnemuende.de/rangs-en.html. For this database to be accessible to NCAR Graphics routines, the files that comprise it must be installed in a directory named "rangs" that is a subdirectory of the directory where the other NCAR Graphics map database files reside (typically $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/database). Alternatively, you may set the environment variable NCARG_RANGS to point to the directory location of the RANGS database files. The RANGS database is capable of much higher resolution than the other databases, but it should not be used for maximal area projections of the whole globe since there are some problems in rendering it at this scale. This database currently consists of coastline data only and has no named areas associated with it.     Please click here for more information on how to download and install the RANGS/GSHHS database.  Dynamic     With version 6.4.0, this is the new default setting. Generally the LowRes database will be used, which is the default in prior versions of NCL. However, if either of the boundary-set resources mpFillBoundarySets or mpOutlineBoundarySets are set to anything other than Geophysical, then the MediumRes database will be used instead. This behavior represents a balance between performance and accuracy for common use-cases. For global-scale maps depicting just the continents and oceans, the LowRes database is more than sufficient, whereas the more detailed MediumRes database would incur additional compute overhead. However, the political boundaries of the MediumRes database are more up-to-date, and are thus favored if any political boundaries are to be drawn.  You may freely switch between the databases after creating a mapplot. However, note that because the databases differ considerably in their area naming schemes, you will be likely to encounter warning messages if you have set any of the specifier resources (mpFillAreaSpecifiers, mpOutlineSpecifiers, mpMaskAreaSpecifiers, or mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers). Default: Dynamic (Ncarg4_0 for NCL versions prior to 6.4.0) 
mpDataResolution (MapPlot) resource of type NhlTMapDataResolution specifies the resolution used to render the map. There are 6 choices: UnspecifiedResolution (Alias: Unspecified)     MapPlot decides what resolution to use based on the range of the map limits currently in effect. Large scale maps will be drawn with high resolution and smaller scale maps with lower resolution.  FinestResolution (Alias: Finest)     Draw the map using the finest resolution possible.  FineResolution (Alias: Fine)     Draw the map using fine resolution.  MediumResolution (Alias: Medium)     Draw the map using medium resolution.  CoarseResolution (Alias: Coarse)     Draw the map using coarse resolution.  CoarsestResolution (Alias: Coarsest)     Draw the map using the coarsest resolution possible.  These designations for resolution are only relative to the other resolutions that can be rendered using the RANGS database. This resource is ignored when using the Ncarg4_0 or Ncarg4_1 databases. Default: UnspecifiedResolution 
mpDataSetName (MapPlot) When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 this string type resource specifies the name of the dataset used to populate the database. Currently there are three possible standard datasets from which to choose: Earth..1     This dataset was created in 1998 and contains geophysical and political boundaries including the states of the United States.  Earth..2     This dataset was created in 1999 and is similar to "Earth..1" except that it contains the country Eritrea, and several countries resulting from the breakup of the USSR that were not included in "Earth..1". It also contains the provinces of Canada, the states of Mexico, and all the counties in the United States.  Earth..3     This dataset was created in 2000 and is like "Earth..2" except that the US counties are replaced with climate divisions within each state.  Earth..4     (1.0 and later.) This dataset was created in 2008. It is much like "Earth..2", but has about 10 times as much detail and is much more accurate. Its coastlines are simplified versions of those in the RANGS database and its political outlines match what one finds on a web site such as Wikimapia. In addition to the provinces of Canada, the states of Mexico, and the states and counties of the conterminus United States, it provides the state/province outlines of Australia, Brazil, China, and India. The ice shelves of Antarctica are included as separate entities, that can be made to appear or not, as desired.  The name of the dataset (e.g. "Earth..1") is actually the basename for a set of files comprising the dataset. Other datasets, such as paleolithic continental boundaries, conforming to the Ncarg4_1 database scheme have been created, but they are not currently part of the standard NCAR Graphics distribution. If you have a dataset that conforms to the scheme, but is not located in the directory where map data is expected to be found (typically $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/database), you may specify a complete pathname (including the dataset basename) as the value of this resource. As with changing the value of mpDataBaseVersion You may freely switch between datasets after creating a mapplot. However, you may encounter warning messages if you have set any of the specifier resources (mpFillAreaSpecifiers, mpOutlineSpecifiers, mpMaskAreaSpecifiers, or mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers) with names that appear in one dataset and not the other. This resource is ignored when using the Ncarg4_0 or RANGS databases. Default: Earth..2 
mpDefaultFillColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the color used to fill all areas within the map projection that, given that mpFillOn is True, are neither filled nor masked. mpDefaultFillColor is constrained to values greater than Transparent (-1). This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the first element of mpFillColors. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpDefaultFillColor takes precedence. Default: 16 
mpDefaultFillPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the fill pattern used to fill all areas within the map projection that, given that mpFillOn is True, are neither filled nor masked. If mpDefaultFillPattern has the value HollowFill (-1), there will be no fill of the ocean area, regardless of the setting of mpDefaultFillColor. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the first element of mpFillPatterns. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpDefaultFillPattern takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: SolidFill 
mpDefaultFillScaleF (MapPlot) The mpDefaultFillScaleF resource controls the scaling of the pattern used to fill all areas within the map projection that, given that mpFillOn is True, are neither filled nor masked. It has no effect for solid fill (SolidFill, fill index 0). Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the first element of mpFillScales. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpDefaultFillScaleF takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
mpDynamicAreaGroups (MapPlot) MapPlot maintains two arrays that assign area group numbers to each area in a MapPlot database. MapPlot uses the area's group numbers to determine its fill attributes, assuming mpFillOn is True and you do not explicitly specify fill attributes for the area. The mpDynamicAreaGroups resource allows you to access and, if desired, set the elements of the dynamic area group array. The elements of this array have the same order as the mpAreaNames array. By default, within the dynamic group arrray MapPlot assigns each area a group number such that adjoining politically distinct land areas are guaranteed to belong to a different group. For this reason the mpDynamicAreaGroups array is sometimes known as the political groups array, since a map whose fill attributes are based on these area groups shows national and perhaps state and even county boundaries as well as physical features. Anytime mpFillBoundarySets is set in such a way that national or U.S. state areas must be distinguished, and the fill attributes are not set explicitly, MapPlot uses the group numbers in the mpDynamicAreaGroups array as indexes into the fill attribute array resources whose associated Mono flag resource is set False. A more thorough description of the situations that result in MapPlot indexing the fill attribute array resources based on the contents of the mpDynamicAreaGroups array is found in the discussion of area fill in the MapPlot object description. You may reassign the group numbers in the mpDynamicAreaGroups array in any manner you please. At minimum and by default there are 10 area groups, but by setting the resource mpAreaGroupCount you can increase the number of area groups to any number up to a maximum of 255. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     See the Ncarg4_0 database table to find the dynamic area group associated with a particular area name.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     There are three datasets available with this database, and the area names available differ depending on the dataset selected. See mpDataSetName for links to tables containing the dynamic area group associated with the area names contained in the available datasets.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is not used and is set to NULL.  Default: <dynamic> 
mpEllipticalBoundary (MapTransformation) When the boolean resource mpEllipticalBoundary is set True, the map projection area is limited to an ellipse inscribed within the normal rectangular perimeter of the viewport. Default: False 
mpFillAreaSpecifiers (MapPlot) specify explicitly the names of areas MapPlot is to fill. Your purpose may be to include an area that would not otherwise be drawn (such as an interior national boundary when mpFillBoundarySets has the value Geophysical) or it may be simply that you want to control the area's fill attributes explicitly using the associated specified fill attribute arrays. The named areas are added to the basic set of fill areas specified using the resource mpFillBoundarySets. You may explicitly specify the fill attributes of areas named in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array using any or all of the three associated attribute array resources, mpSpecifiedFillColors, mpSpecifiedFillPatterns, and mpSpecifiedFillScales. The elements of each of these arrays correspond one-for-one with the elements of the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array. Attributes set using these arrays override all other resources involving fill attributes, including the fill attribute Mono flags. Each of these arrays accept a pre-defined special value allowing you to specify individual elements as "unset." If you also using area masking, note that there is an order of precedence for fill and masking. Explicitly named areas take precedence over area groupings, and small areas take precedence over enclosing larger areas. Otherwise masking takes precedence over filling. Note that the names from different MapPlot databases and datasets are not necessarily compatible. Therefore, if mpFillAreaSpecifiers is non-NULL when you set mpDataBaseVersion and/or mpDataSetName to a different value, you are likely to encounter warning messages unless you also set mpFillAreaSpecifiers using names compatible with the new database. You can retrieve a list of compatible names by getting the value of mpAreaNames. Case is not significant for mpFillAreaSpecifiers string values. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     Within the list you may include groups of areas defined by a number of pre-defined string constants. In addition, a substring matching facility allows you to specify groups of areas that share a common substring. When a fill attribute for a specified fill area is not explicitly set, MapPlot uses its normal method of setting fill attributes based on area group assignments. The group number is chosen from the mpFixedAreaGroups array or from the mpDynamicAreaGroups array depending on the setting of the resource mpSpecifiedFillPriority. You can override the general priority for an individual area by prepending an exclamation point ('!') to the area's name.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     The NullArea string constant is also defined. There is no substring matching facility. When a fill attribute for a specified fill area is not explicitly set, MapPlot uses its normal method of setting fill attributes based on area group assignments. The group number is chosen from the mpFixedAreaGroups array if the area's type is 1 (mpGeophysical) or if its type is 2 (mpContinental) and its parent is Water. Otherwise, the group number is chosen from the mpDynamicAreaGroups array. The use of the exclamation point ('!') prefix and the mpSpecifiedFillPriority resource is not supported.     2.0.a034 and later.     In addition to individual area names, you can specify subdivisions of certain areas (states, provinces, and counties) using pre-defined group names appended to the area name following a colon (':') character.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is ignored.  Default: NULL 
mpFillBoundarySets (MapPlot) You set this resource of type NhlTMapBoundarySets to specify the basic boundary set used for fill areas. Given the basic boundaries, you can then add other areas by specifying area names outlines in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers string array resource. You can also desiginate areas to be masked (left unfilled) by specifying area names in the mpMaskAreaSpecifiers string array resource. NoBoundaries     MapPlot will draw area fill only for areas specified by name in mpFillAreaSpecifiers and not specified in mpMaskAreaSpecifiers.  Geophysical     MapPlot will draw area fill for geophysical features: land, oceans, and inland water bodies. You may specify by name other areas to be filled in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers resource.  National     MapPlot will individually fill all national boundary areas. Geophysical features are implicitly included. You may specify by name other areas to be filled in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers resource.  USStates     MapPlot will fill regions comprising the states of the United States. When using the Ncarg4_0 database, Alaska and Hawaii are not included, although a few areas outside the U.S. proper, including the Bahamas and a few lakes extending into Canadian territory, are drawn. When using the Ncarg4_1 database, Alaska and Hawaii are drawn, but no non-U.S. territory is included. You may add geophysical and/or national areas by name using the mpFillAreaSpecifiers resource.  GeophysicalAndUSStates     MapPlot will draw area fill for all global geophysical features as well as for the states of the United States. Other national boundaries do not appear unless you specify them by name using the mpFillAreaSpecifiers resource.  AllBoundaries     MapPlot draws area fill for all the boundaries for the database/dataset currently in use. When using the Ncarg4_0 database this includes geophysical and national boundaries as well as all U.S. states and inland water. When using the Ncarg4_1 database, depending on the dataset, this may include Canadian provinces, Mexican and US States, and counties or climate divisions of US states.  When the Ncarg4_1 database is in use, specifying an area name whose mpAreaTypes is 1 or 2 (mpGeophysical or mpContinental) has the effect of suppressing type 3 or higher fill areas within its borders even if the setting of mpFillBoundarySets would otherwise imply that they be drawn . For instance, setting mpFillAreaSpecifiers to the value "Africa" would have the effect of suppressing national boundaries within the African continent. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: Geophysical 
mpFillColor (MapPlot) When mpMonoFillColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets a uniform fill color for all MapPlot areas, except for those whose fill color is set explicitly using the mpSpecifiedFillColors array resource. Default: Foreground 
mpFillColors (MapPlot) If mpMonoFillColor is False, each element of the array specifies the HLU color index used to fill the MapPlot areas belonging a particular area group. The first element of the array specifies the default color for regions within the map projection area that contain neither a filled nor a masked area. The second, third, and fourth elements specify colors for the fixed (geophysical) area groups: the Ocean group, the Land group, and the InlandWater group. For convenience, there are named alias resources for these first four elements of the array: mpDefaultFillColor, mpOceanFillColor, mpLandFillColor, and mpInlandWaterFillColor. If you set any of the alias resources at the same time as the mpFillColors array resource is set, the named alias resource value overrides. The remaining elements (by default, the fifth through the tenth elements) specify colors for the dynamic groups. If mpAreaGroupCount is increased from its minimum (and default) value of 10, more elements become available for additional dynamic group colors. Default: By default the first 10 elements are assigned the following sequence of HLU color indexes: 16, 10, 8, 10, 26, 22, 11, 23, 13, 19. This choice of colors is intended to look reasonable with the "default" color map. 
mpFillDotSizeF (MapPlot) This resource sets a uniform dot size, in NDC units, for the stipple dot fill pattern. The default value of 0.0 causes the dots to be drawn as before, using a workstation dependent minimum dot size. A caveat is that individual dots are not clipped around the edges of fill areas; this becomes more noticeable as the dot size increases. Default: 0.0 
mpFillDrawOrder (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when MapPlot area fill is drawn relative to other elements of the plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw area fill before the standard draw phase; the fill underlies all other MapPlot elements drawn during the predraw phase and anything drawn during the draw and postdraw phases.  Draw     Draw area fill during the standard draw; the fill overlays anything drawn during the predraw phase but underlies any other MapPlot elements drawn during the draw phase and anything drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw area fill after the standard draw; the fill overlays anything drawn during the predraw and draw phases but underlies any other MapPlot elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  Default: Draw 
mpFillOn (MapPlot) This boolean resource is the master switch for drawing of MapPlot area fill. If True, the MapPlot enables drawing of map area fill. Otherwise, no map fill will appear, regardless of the setting of any other area-fill-related resources. Default: False (True for some gsn_csm_xxxx routines) 
mpFillPatternBackground (MapPlot) mpFillPatternBackground specifies the HLU index of the color used for the background in areas filled with any HLU fill pattern besides SolidFill. If this resource has the value Transparent (-1), no color will be appear behind the fill pattern. The effect will be that the pattern appears transparently on top of anything already drawn. Default: Background 
mpFillPattern (MapPlot) When mpMonoFillPattern is set True, this resource of type NhlTFillIndex sets a uniform fill pattern for all MapPlot areas, except for those whose fill pattern is set explicitly using the mpSpecifiedFillPatterns array resource. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: SolidFill 
mpFillPatterns (MapPlot) If mpMonoFillPattern is False, each element of the array specifies the HLU fill pattern index used to fill the MapPlot areas belonging a particular area group. The first element of the array specifies the default pattern for regions within the map projection area that contain neither a filled nor a masked area. The second, third, and fourth elements specify patterns for the fixed (geophysical) area groups: the Ocean group, the Land group, and the InlandWater group. For convenience, there are named alias resources for these first four elements of the array: mpDefaultFillPattern, mpOceanFillPattern, mpLandFillPattern, and mpInlandWaterFillPattern. If you set any of the alias resources at the same time as the mpFillPatterns array resource is set, the named alias resource value overrides. The remaining elements (by default, the fifth through the tenth elements) specify patterns for the dynamic groups. If mpAreaGroupCount is increased from its minimum (and default) value of 10, more elements become available for additional dynamic area group patterns. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: MapPlot assigns patterns sequentially, beginning with HLU fill pattern index 1 for the first element of mpFillPatterns. 
mpFillScaleF (MapPlot) When mpMonoFillPattern is set True, this floating point resource sets a uniform fill pattern scale factor for all MapPlot areas, except for those whose fill scale factor is set explicitly using the mpSpecifiedFillScales array resource. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
mpFillScales (MapPlot) If mpMonoFillPattern is False, each element of the array specifies the scale factor applied to the fill pattern used to fill MapPlot areas belonging a particular area group. The first element of the array specifies the default fill pattern scale factor for regions within the map projection area that contain neither a filled nor a masked area. The second, third, and fourth elements specify scale factors for the fixed (geophysical) area groups: the Ocean group, the Land group, and the InlandWater group. For convenience, there are named alias resources for these first four elements of the array: mpDefaultFillScaleF, mpOceanFillScaleF, mpLandFillScaleF, and mpInlandWaterFillScaleF. If you set any of the alias resources at the same time as the mpFillScales array resource is set, the named alias resource value overrides. The remaining elements (by default, the fifth through the tenth elements) specify patterns for the dynamic groups. If mpAreaGroupCount is increased from its minimum (and default) value of 10, more elements become available for additional dynamic area group fill scale values. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 for all elements 
mpFixedAreaGroups (MapPlot) MapPlot maintains two arrays that assign area group numbers to each area in a MapPlot database. MapPlot uses the area's group numbers to determine its fill attributes, assuming mpFillOn is True and you do not explicitly specify fill attributes for the area. The mpFixedAreaGroups resource allows read-only access for informational purposes only to the fixed area group array, which, as its name implies, you cannot modify. The elements of this array have the same order as the mpAreaNames array. Within the array each area in the database is assigned to area group 1, 2, or 3. These are respectively the Ocean group, the Land group and the InlandWater group. For this reason mpFixedAreaGroups is sometimes known as the geophysical area groups array, since a map whose fill attributes are based on these area groups shows only physical as opposed to political features. If fill is turned on and you set mpFillBoundarySets to the value Geophysical and do not explicitly specify any areas using the mpFillAreaSpecifiers resource, MapPlot will use the mpFixedAreaGroups group numbers to determine fill attributes for all areas of the map. For each of the three fill attribute types that has its Mono flag resource set False, the area's group number is used as an index into the fill attribute array resource. This yields, for mpFillColors, an HLU color index, for mpFillPatterns, an HLU fill pattern index, and for mpFillScales, a fill pattern scaling factor. A more complete description of the situations that result in MapPlot indexing the fill attribute array resources based on the contents of the mpFixedAreaGroups array is found in the discussion of area fill in the MapPlot object description. Note that you can set the fill attributes of the area groups assigned by the mpFixedAreaGroups array using a set of convenience resources that act as named aliases for the Ocean, Land, and InlandWater elements of mpFillColors, mpFillPatterns, and mpFillScales. These resources are as follows: mpOceanFillColor, mpOceanFillPattern, mpOceanFillScaleF, mpLandFillColor, mpLandFillPattern, mpLandFillScaleF, mpInlandWaterFillColor, mpInlandWaterFillPattern, and mpInlandWaterFillScaleF. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     See the Ncarg4_0 database table to find the fixed area group associated with a particular area name.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     There are three datasets available with this database, and the area names available differ depending on the dataset selected. See mpDataSetName for links to tables containing the fixed area group associated with the area names contained in the available datasets.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is not used and is set to NULL.  Default: <dynamic> 
mpGeophysicalLineColor (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTColorIndex can be set using a named color string or an integer value. This resource applies to the outlines of all continents, islands, and inland water bodies. However, when mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and the outlines of one or more U.S. states are drawn, the portion of North America whose outline is contiguous with the U.S. border is rendered using mpUSStateLineColor. Default: Foreground 
mpGeophysicalLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the index specifying the dash pattern used to render geophysical boundary lines. This resource applies to the outlines of all continents, islands and inland water bodies. However, when mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and the outlines of one or more U.S. states are drawn, the portion of North America whose outline is contiguous with the U.S. border is rendered using mpUSStateLineDashPattern. Default: SolidLine 
mpGeophysicalLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to draw geophysical boundary outlines. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. This resource applies to the outlines of all continents, islands and inland water bodies. However, when mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and the outlines of one or more U.S. states are drawn, the portion of North America whose outline is contiguous with the U.S. border is rendered using mpUSStateLineDashSegLenF. MapPlot sets the default value of mpNationalLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpGeophysicalLineThicknessF (MapPlot) Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw geophysical boundary outlines. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource applies to the outlines of all continents, islands and inland water bodies. However, when mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and the outlines of one or more U.S. states are drawn, the portion of North America whose outline is contiguous with the U.S. border is rendered using mpUSStateLineDashSegLenF. Default: 1.0 
mpGreatCircleLinesOn (MapTransformation) This resource selects between two methods for defining the transformation of lines or edges between defined points of the data space graphics primitive functions, NhlDataPolygon and NhlDataPolyline. If mpGreatCircleLinesOn is False, the space between the defined points is treated as if the latitude/longitude coordinate system were cartesian. This method of performing the transformation results in all straight lines between the defined points when mpProjection is set to CylindricalEquidistant. Another characteristic of this method is that, for any projection, a line between two points at the same latitude is coincident with the line of latitude itself. If mpGreatCircleLinesOn is set True, lines between defined points follow a great circle route, the shortest distance on the surface of the globe between the two points. In this case, lines appear curved on a cylindrical equidistant projection, except for the special cases of lines between points of equal longitude or of lines drawn near the equator. For any projection, lines between points of equal latitude diverge farther and farther from the line of latitude as the distance from the equator increases. Default: False 
mpGridAndLimbDrawOrder (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when MapPlot draws the grid lines representing latitude and longitude relative to other elements of the plot. When a limb line representing the edge of the visible surface of the projection is required, MapPlot always renders it at the same time as the grid lines. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw grid lines before the standard draw phase; the grid lines overlay MapPlot fill drawn during the predraw phase but underlie other predraw phase MapPlot elements and anything drawn during the draw and postdraw phases.  Draw     Draw grid lines during the standard draw; the grid lines overlay anything drawn during the predraw phase and MapPlot fill drawn during the draw phase but underlie other draw phase MapPlot elements and anything drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw grid lines after the standard draw; the grid lines overlay anything drawn during the predraw and draw phases and MapPlot fill drawn during the postdraw phase but underlie other postdraw phase MapPlot elements.  Default: PostDraw 
mpGridAndLimbOn (MapPlot) This boolean resource determines whether the MapPlot object draws grid lines representing latitude and longitude as well as (when appropriate) a limb line around the edge of the visible surface of the map projection. Default: True 
mpGridLatSpacingF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the spacing, in degrees, between MapPlot grid lines representing latitude. Use this resource if you want to set the latitude spacing independently of the longitude spacing. Note that setting mpGridSpacingF at the same time or subsequently overrides the value of this resource. Default: 15.0 
mpGridLineColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of a color used to draw the grid representing latitudes and longitudes. Default: Foreground 
mpGridLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of a dash pattern used to draw the grid representing latitudes and longitudes. Default: SolidLine 
mpGridLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to draw the grid representing latitudes and longitudes. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. MapPlot sets the default value of mpGridLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpGridLineThicknessF (MapPlot) This resource determines the thickness of the lines used to draw the grid representing latitudes and longitudes. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
mpGridLonSpacingF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the spacing, in degrees, between MapPlot grid lines representing longitude. Use this resource if you want to set the longitude spacing independently of the latitude spacing. Note that setting mpGridSpacingF at the same time or subsequently overrides the value of this resource. Default: 15.0 
mpGridMaskMode (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTMapGridMaskMode specifies how the MapPlot object should mask the grid representing latitudes and longitudes. There are seven choices: MaskNone     MapPlot does not mask the grid. Grid lines appear over the entire visible map projection area.  MaskOcean     MapPlot masks the grid over areas of the map occupied by any part of the global ocean.  MaskNotOcean     MapPlot masks the grid over areas of the map that are not part of the global ocean, including bodies of water within the interior of continents.  MaskLand     MapPlot masks the grid over areas of the map that represent land. Bodies of water within the interior of continents remain unmasked.  MaskNotLand     MapPlot masks the grid over all areas of the map that do not represent land, including bodies of water within the interior of continents.  MaskFillArea     MapPlot masks the grid over filled or masked areas in the map. The grid is drawn only over 'background' areas within the map projection, that is, those areas of the MapPlot that would be filled (assuming fill is enabled) using the color specified by mpDefaultFillColor.  MaskMaskArea     MapPlot masks the grid only over areas named in the mpMaskAreaSpecifiers array.  When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: MaskNone 
mpGridMaxLatF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the maximum absolute value of the latitude at which a latitude grid line may appear. For instance, if you set mpGridMaxLatF to 70.0, no latitude lines will appear between 70 degrees and 90 degrees or between -70 degrees and -90 degrees. If the latitude spacing were set to 20.0, then, in this case, the highest and lowest latitude lines would be at 60 degrees and -60 degrees. Default: 90.0 
mpGridPolarLonSpacingF (MapPlot) This resource has an effect only when the map projection is such that the North and South poles project to single points. In this case, it controls the way longitude lines are continued in the area between the pole and the latitude line nearest the pole. Basically it allows you to set an alternate spacing for longitude lines near the poles, generally for the purpose of avoiding overcrowding. For instance, if mpGridPolarLonSpacingF is set to its default value of 90.0 and the longitudinal spacing is set to 15.0, then only the longitude lines that are multiples of 90.0 continue to the poles. Note that if the longitudinal spacing were set to 20.0, lines would continue only at multiples of 180.0, since there would be no longitude lines to continue at 90.0 and 270.0. Default: 15.0 
mpGridSpacingF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the spacing, in degrees, between MapPlot grid lines representing latitude and longitude. Use this resource if you want the spacing to be equal in latitude and longitude. Setting this resource overrides any values set for the resources mpGridLatSpacingF and mpGridLonSpacingF and causes them both to be set to the value given mpGridSpacingF. Default: 15.0 
mpInlandWaterFillColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the color used to fill areas representing bodies of water except for the oceans. mpInlandWaterFillColor is constrained to values greater than -1 (Transparent). This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the fourth element of mpFillColors. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpInlandWaterFillColor takes precedence. Default: 10 
mpInlandWaterFillPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the fill pattern used to fill areas representing bodies of water except for the oceans. If mpInlandWaterFillPattern has the value HollowFill (-1), there will be no fill of the inland water area, regardless of the setting of mpInlandWaterFillColor. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the fourth element of mpFillPatterns. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpInlandWaterFillPattern takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: SolidFill 
mpInlandWaterFillScaleF (MapPlot) The mpInlandWaterFillScaleF resource controls the scaling of the pattern used to fill areas representing bodies of water except for the oceans. It has no effect for solid fill (SolidFill, fill pattern index 0). Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the fourth element of mpFillScales. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpInlandWaterFillScaleF takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
mpLabelDrawOrder (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when MapPlot labels are drawn relative to other elements of the plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw labels before the standard draw phase; the labels overlay all other MapPlot elements drawn during the predraw phase but underlie anything drawn during the draw and postdraw phases.  Draw     Draw labels during the standard draw; the labels overlay anything drawn during the predraw phase and any other MapPlot elements drawn during the draw phase but underlie anything drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw labels after the standard draw; the labels overlay anything drawn during the predraw and draw phases and all other MapPlot elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  Default: PostDraw 
mpLabelFontColor (MapPlot) This resource specifies the hlu color index used to draw the characters used for MapPlot labels. Default: True 
mpLabelFontHeightF (MapPlot) This resource controls the height in NDC of characters used in the MapPlot labels. The MapPlot text height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set mpLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> -- 0.008 for a viewport width of 0.6 
mpLabelsOn (MapPlot) This boolean resource determines whether the MapPlot object draws labels identifying the equator ("EQ"), Greenwich Meridian ("GM"), International Dateline ("ID"), North Pole ("NP"), and South Pole ("SP"). Default: False 
mpLambertMeridianF (MapTransformation) When mpProjection is set to the value LambertConformal, this resource specifies the central meridian (line of longitude in degrees) of the projection. This resource has nearly the same meaning that mpCenterLonF has for the other projections. V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 0.0 
mpLambertParallel1F (MapTransformation) When mpProjection is set to the value LambertConformal, this resource specifies one of the two standard parallels (lines of latitude in degrees) used to define the conic projection. A simpler conic projection is defined when mpLambertParallel1F and mpLambertParallel2F are equal. Normally, mpLambertParallel1F and mpLambertParallel2F should not be more than 90.0 degrees apart. V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: .001 
mpLambertParallel2F (MapTransformation) When mpProjection is set to the value LambertConformal, this resource specifies one of the two standard parallels (lines of latitude in degrees) used to define the conic projection. A simpler conic projection is defined when mpLambertParallel1F and mpLambertParallel2F are equal. Normally, mpLambertParallel1F and mpLambertParallel2F should not be more than 90.0 degrees apart. V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 89.999 
mpLandFillColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the color used to fill areas of land not given a special group color. mpLandFillColor is constrained to values greater than -1 (Transparent). This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the third element of mpFillColors. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpLandFillColor takes precedence. Default: 8 
mpLandFillPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the fill pattern used to fill areas of land not given a special group color. If mpLandFillPattern has the value HollowFill (-1), there will be no fill of the land area, regardless of the setting of mpInlandWaterFillColor. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the third element of mpFillPatterns. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpLandFillPattern takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: SolidFill 
mpLandFillScaleF (MapPlot) The mpLandFillScaleF resource controls the scaling of the pattern used to fill areas of land not given a special group color. It has no effect for solid fill (SolidFill, fill pattern index 0). Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the third element of mpFillScales. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpLandFillScaleF takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
mpLeftAngleF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Angles, this resource specifies the positive angle in degrees left from the center to the edge of the projection, or, if using a satellite projection, the displacement angle left from the satellite line of sight to the projection center. Note that direction of the line over which the angle is measured remains parallel to the top of the viewport, regardless of the rotation angle applied to the projection. mpLeftAngleF has a maximum allowable value that varies depending on the projection. Default: 80.0 
mpLeftCornerLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Corners, this resource specifies the latitude, in degrees, of the left corner point. Default: 0.0 
mpLeftCornerLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Corners, this resource specifies the longitude, in degrees, of the left corner point. Default: 0.0 
mpLeftMapPosF (MapTransformation) This read-only resource contains the coordinate of the left edge of the projected area in NDC space. Default: 0.0 
mpLeftNDCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NDC, this resource specifies the left edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Device Coordinates. If mpLeftNDCF is set to a value greater than mpRightNDCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. Since the relationship between the map projection area and NDC coordinates changes whenever the map limits are changed, as well as when the viewport area is moved or resized, MapTransformation resets the value of mpLeftNDCF to the NDC value of the left edge of the projected area at the end of any update to the transformation. Default: <dynamic> 
mpLeftNPCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NPC, this resource specifies the left edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Projection Coordinates. mpLeftNPCF is constrained to values in the range 0.0 through 1.0. If mpLeftNPCF is set to a value greater than mpRightNPCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. The value of mpLeftNPCF is updated whenever the map limits are set using any of the map limit modes. Default: 0.0 
mpLeftPointLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the latitude, in degrees, of a point along the left edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpLeftPointLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the longitude, in degrees, of a point along the left edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpLeftWindowF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Window, this resource specifies the value, in window coordinates, of the left edge of the projection. Default: 0.0 
mpLimbLineColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the color used for the limb line drawn at the edge of visibility in certain map projections. Default: Foreground 
mpLimbLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of a dash pattern used for the limb line drawn at the edge of visibility in certain map projections. Default: SolidLine 
mpLimbLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used for the limb line drawn at the edge of visibility in certain map projections. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. MapPlot sets the default value of mpLimbLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpLimbLineThicknessF (MapPlot) This resource determines the thickness of the limb line drawn at the edge of visibility in certain map projections. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
mpLimitMode (MapTransformation) This resource of type NhlTMapLimitMode specifies how MapTransformation determines the extent of the projected globe that is mapped into the viewport area. It has eight possible settings: MaximalArea     The maximum viewable area of the globe allowed by the projection is mapped into the viewport area.  LatLon     MapTransformation maps into the viewport the maximum viewable portion of the area given the projection, the projection center, and bounded by latitudes mpMinLatF and mpMaxLatF and longitudes mpMinLonF and mpMaxLonF. If you set boundaries such that the resulting area has zero extent, MapTransformation issues a warning and resets mpLimitMode to the value NhlMAXIMALAREA. If you set mpMinLatF to a value greater than mpMaxLatF or mpMinLonF to a value greater than mpMaxLatF, MapTransformation issues a warning and exchanges the values.  Angles     For most projections, the area mapped into the viewport is based on the positive angular distance from the center of the projection, in each of the four directions determined by the resources mpRightAngleF, mpLeftAngleF,mpBottomAngleF, and mpTopAngleF. For the satellite projection, the angles represent angular deviation from the line of sight from the satellite to the projection center. Angular limits are not supported if mpProjection has the value NhlLAMBERTCONFORMAL or NhlROTATEDMERCATOR. Note that left, right, bottom, and top are oriented with respect to the viewplane; therefore, if mpCenterRotF has a non-zero value, the angles represent varying combinations of latitudinal and longitudinal components.     Depending on the projection, the maximum allowable value for each of the angle resources varies, as follows:     Angle projection limits:     Orthographic         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 90.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 90.0      Stereographic         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 180.0      LambertEqualArea         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 180.0      Gnomonic         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 85.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 85.0      AzimuthalEquidistant         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 180.0      Satellite         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 90.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 90.0      Mollweide         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 180.0      Mercator         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 85.0      CylindricalEquidistant         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 90.0      LambertConformal         not supported      Robinson         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 90.0      CylindricalEqualArea         mpLeftAngleF and mpRightAngleF: 180.0         mpBottomAngleFand mpTopAngleF: 90.0      RotatedMercator         not supported      If you attempt to set one of the angle resources to a value outside the range, MapTransformation issues a warning and coerces the value to the limiting value. If you set angles in such a way that the resulting map extent has zero area, MapTransformation issues a warning and resets mpLimitMode to NhlMAXIMALAREA.     V4.1 Status Note 3  NPC     NPC limits the area based on "Normalized Projection Coordinates," which map the maximal area of the projection into a rectangle bounded by 0.0 and 1.0 horizontally and vertically. Use the resources mpLeftNPCF, mpRightNPCF, mpBottomNPCF, and mpTopNPCF to set normalized projection coordinate limits. If you set NPC boundaries such that the resulting area has zero extent, MapTransformation issues a warning and resets mpLimitMode to the value NhlMAXIMALAREA. If you set mpLeftNPCF to a value greater than mpRightNPCF or mpBottomNPCF to a value greater than mpTopNPCF, MapTransformation issues a warning and exchanges the values. MapTransformation keeps the NPC resources updated to their current value no matter which method is used to set the map limits.  NDC     NDC limits the area based on the current location of the projected map in Normalized Device Coordinates. Use the resources mpLeftNDCF, mpRightNDCF, mpBottomNDCF, and mpTopNDCF to set normalized device coordinate limits. If you set NDC boundaries such that the resulting area has zero extent, MapTransformation issues a warning and resets mpLimitMode to the value NhlMAXIMALAREA. If you set mpLeftNDCF to a value greater than mpRightNDCF or mpBottomNDCF to a value greater than mpTopNDCF, MapTransformation issues a warning and exchanges the values. Note that setting these resources usually causes the mapping between the projection space and NDC space to change. Changes to the location of the size or shape of the viewport into which the map is projected also modify the mapping into NDC space. Therefore, at the completion of each SetValues call, MapTransformation internally sets the value of each mp...NDCF resource to the new location of the original projected coordinate: that is, to one of the boundaries of the projected area.  Corners     MapTransformation maps into the viewport a rectangular area with one corner at the point mpLeftCornerLatF and mpLeftCornerLonF, and the opposite corner at the point mpRightCornerLatF and mpRightCornerLonF. The value of mpLeftCornerLonF should be less than mpRightCornerLonF. If either point is outside the maximal area given the projection and projection center, a warning is returned and the limit mode defaults to MaximalArea.  Points     MapTransformation maps into the viewport an area defined by a viewspace rectangle containing the four points defined by mpLeftPointLatF, mpLeftPointLonF, mpRightPointLatF, mpRightPointLonF, mpBottomPointLatF, mpBottomPointLonF, mpTopPointLatF, and mpTopPointLonF. If any point is outside the maximal area given the projection and projection center, a warning is returned and the limit mode defaults to MaximalArea mode.  Window     MapTransformation maps into the viewport an area bounded by the window coordinates specified by the resources mpLeftWindowF, mpRightWindowF, mpBottomWindowF, and mpTopWindowF. The window coordinates are in an intermediate rectangular coordinate system into which the map coordinates are mapped prior to the mapping into NDC coordinates. Its extents vary depending on the value of mpProjection. If you set mpLeftWindowF to a value greater than mpRightWindowF, or mpBottomWindowF to a value greater than mpTopWindowF, MapTransformation issues a warning and exchanges the values. MapTransformation keeps the Window resources updated to their current value no matter which method is used to set the map limits.  Default: MaximalArea 
mpMaskAreaSpecifiers (MapPlot) Specify the names of areas MapPlot is to mask. These areas are subtracted from the fill area set specified using the resource mpFillBoundarySets and mpFillAreaSpecifiers. There is an order of precedence for fill and masking. Explicitly named areas take precedence over area groupings, and small areas take precedence over enclosing larger areas. Otherwise masking takes precedence over filling. Note that the names from different MapPlot databases are not necessarily compatible. Therefore, if mpMaskAreaSpecifiers is non-NULL when you set mpDataBaseVersion and/or mpDataSetName to a different value, you are likely to encounter warning messages unless you also set mpMaskAreaSpecifiers using names compatible with the new database. You can retrieve a list of compatible names by getting the value of mpAreaNames. Case is not significant for mpMaskAreaSpecifiers string values. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     In addition to the individual area names, you may include certain pre-defined groups of areas using a number of pre-defined string constants. Moreover, there is a substring matching facility that allows you to specify groups of areas sharing a common substring.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     The NullArea string constant is defined. Due to the hierarchical nature of this database many area groupings occur as named entities in their own right. For instance, you can mask filling of the small islands of the Pacific Ocean by including the string "Pacific Islands" as an element of mpMaskAreaSpecifiers. There is no substring matching facility.     2.0.a034 and later.     In addition to individual area names, you can specify subdivisions of certain areas (states, provinces, and counties) using pre-defined group names appended to the area name following a colon (':') character.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is ignored.  Default: NULL 
mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers (MapPlot) 2.0.a034 and later. Specify the names of outlines MapPlot is to mask, if the boolean resource mpOutlineMaskingOn is set to True. These outlines are subtracted from the outline set specified using the resource mpOutlineBoundarySets and mpOutlineSpecifiers. Note that commonly the outline of an area shares its border with a number of other areas. Masking the outline of an area causes all these common borders not to be drawn. There is an order of precedence for outline drawing masking. Explicitly named outlines take precedence over outline groupings, and small outlines take precedence over enclosing larger outlines. Otherwise masking takes precedence over filling. Note that the names from different MapPlot databases and/or datasets are not necessarily compatible. Therefore, if mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers is non-NULL when you set mpDataBaseVersion and/or mpDataSetName to a different value, you are likely to encounter warning messages unless you also set mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers using names compatible with the new database. You can retrieve a list of compatible names for the current database/dataset by getting the value of mpAreaNames. Case is not significant for mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers string values. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     In addition to the individual area names, you may include certain pre-defined groups of areas using a number of pre-defined string constants. Moreover, there is a substring matching facility that allows you to specify groups of areas sharing a common substring.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     The NullArea string constant is defined. Due to the hierarchical nature of this database, many area groupings occur as named entities in their own right. For instance, you can mask the outlines of the small islands of the Pacific Ocean by including the string "Pacific Islands" as an element of mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers. There is no substring matching facility.     In addition to individual area names, you can specify subdivisions of certain areas (states, provinces, and counties) using pre-defined group names appended to the area name following a colon (':') character.     There are some subtleties involved in outline masking when using the Ncarg4_1 database that do not occur with area masking. Areas with higher types override lower typed areas. For instance, if you want to mask interior water bodies to simplify the appearance of a map, you might specify "Water" as an element of mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers. However, this would cause all ocean coast lines to disappear because "Ocean" is a member of the "Water" hierarchy. You can overcome this problem by adding "Ocean" to the mpOutlineSpecifier array resource. Since "Ocean" is a type 2 entity it overrides the masking of "Water", one of the two type 1 entities. Also If you add national, state, or county outlines to a map in which the inland water bodies have been masked, you will find that some water bodies still appear. That is because they form part of the the boundary between entities that have been specified.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is ignored.  Default: NULL 
mpMaxLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value LatLon, this resource specifies the maximum latitude bounding the area to be mapped to the viewport. It should not be greater than 90.0. Default: 90.0 
mpMaxLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value LatLon, this resource specifies the maximum longitude bounding the area to be mapped to the viewport. It may be set to any value in the range -540.0 to 540.0 such that mpMaxLonF minus mpMinLonF is greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 360.0. Default: 180.0 
mpMinLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value LatLon, this resource specifies the minimum latitude bounding the area to be mapped to the viewport. It should not be less than -90.0. Default: -90.0 
mpMinLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value LatLon, this resource specifies the minimum longitude bounding the area to be mapped to the viewport. It may be set to any value in the range -540.0 to 540.0 such that mpMaxLonF minus mpMinLonF is greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 360.0. Default: -180.0 
mpMonoFillColor (MapPlot) When set True, all MapPlot fill areas (other than those whose color is set explicitly using the mpSpecifiedFillColors array resource) are set to a single color, as specified by the value of the scalar resource mpFillColor. When False, the elements of the array resource mpFillColors control the fill color indexes for MapPlot areas based on the area group numbers assigned to each area. Default: False 
mpMonoFillPattern (MapPlot) When set True, all MapPlot fill areas (other than those whose pattern is set explicitly using the mpSpecifiedFillPatterns array resource) are set to a single pattern, as specified by the value of the scalar resource mpFillPattern. When False, the elements of the array resource mpFillPatterns control the fill pattern indexes for MapPlot areas based on the area group numbers assigned to each area. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: True 
mpMonoFillScale (MapPlot) When set True, all MapPlot fill areas (other than those whose fill scale is set explicitly using the mpSpecifiedFillScales array resource) use a single fill pattern scale factor, as specified by the value of the scalar resource mpFillScaleF. When False, the elements of the array resource mpFillScales control the fill scale values for MapPlot areas based on the area group numbers assigned to each area. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: True 
mpNationalLineColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of a color used to render interior national boundary outlines. Note that this resource applies only to lines used to draw interior national boundaries. Lines separating continents, oceans, and inland water bodies are not affected, except that if mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and US States are drawn, the US national border is rendered using mpUSStateLineColor When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: Foreground 
mpNationalLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of a dash pattern used to render interior national boundary outlines. Note that this resource applies only to lines used to draw interior national boundaries. Lines separating continents, oceans, and inland water bodies are not affected, except that if mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and US States are drawn, the US national border is rendered using mpUSStateDashPattern. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: SolidLine 
mpNationalLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to draw national boundary outlines. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. Note that this resource applies only to lines used to draw interior national boundaries. Lines separating continents, oceans, and inland water bodies are not affected, except that if mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and US States are drawn, the US national border is rendered using mpUSStateDashSegLenF. MapPlot sets the default value of mpNationalLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpNationalLineThicknessF (MapPlot) Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw national boundary outlines. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Note that this resource applies only to lines used to draw interior national boundaries. Note that this resource applies only to lines used to draw interior national boundaries. Lines separating continents, oceans, and inland water bodies are not affected, except that if mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) and US States are drawn, the US national border is rendered using mpUSStateLineThicknessF. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
mpOceanFillColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the color used to fill areas representing the oceans. mpOceanFillColor is constrained to values greater than -1 (Transparent). This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the second element of mpFillColors. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpOceanFillColor takes precedence. Default: 10 
mpOceanFillPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the fill pattern used to fill areas representing the oceans. If mpOceanFillPattern has the value HollowFill (-1), there will be no fill of the ocean area, regardless of the setting of mpOceanFillColor. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the second element of mpFillPatterns. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpOceanFillPattern takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: SolidFill 
mpOceanFillScaleF (MapPlot) The mpOceanFillScaleF resource controls the scaling of the pattern used to fill areas representing the oceans. It has no effect for solid fill (SolidFill, fill pattern index 0). Values greater than 1.0 make the pattern spacing bigger than the default spacing, resulting in a fill that appears less dense. Values less than 1.0 have the opposite effect. Values less than or equal to 0.0 are invalid, generate a warning message, and are reset to the default value, 1.0. This resource provides an alternate method of setting the value of the second element of mpFillScales. If both resources are set in the same call, the value of mpOceanFillScaleF takes precedence. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
mpOutlineBoundarySets (MapPlot) You set this resource of type NhlTMapBoundarySets to specify the basic boundary set used to render area outlines. Given the basic boundaries, you can then add other outline areas by specifying area names in the mpOutlineSpecifiers string array resource. There are six choices: NoBoundaries     MapPlot will draw area outlines only for areas specified by name in mpOutlineSpecifiers.  Geophysical     MapPlot will draw area outlines for geophysical features: continents, oceans, islands, and inland water areas. Specific national boundary lines may be added by name in mpOutlineSpecifiers.  National     MapPlot will draw area outlines delineating all national boundary areas as contained in the MapPlot database being used. All the geophysical features specified by Geophysical are implicitly included. You may add U.S. State area outlines by name using the mpOutlineSpecifiers resource.  USStates     MapPlot will draw area outlines delineating the states of the United States. When using the Ncarg4_0 database, Alaska and Hawaii are not included, although a few areas outside the U.S. proper, including the Bahamas and a few lakes extending into Canadian territory, are drawn. When using the Ncarg4_1 database, Alaska and Hawaii are drawn, but no non-U.S. territory is included. You may add geophysical and/or national areas by name using the mpOutlineSpecifiers resource.  GeophysicalAndUSStates     MapPlot will draw area outlines of all global geophysical features as well as the states of the U.S. Other national boundaries do not appear unless you specify them by name using the mpOutlineSpecifiers resource.  AllBoundaries     MapPlot draws outlines for all the boundaries for the database/dataset currently in use. When using the Ncarg4_0 database this includes geophysical and national boundaries as well as all U.S. states and inland water. When using the Ncarg4_1 database, depending on the dataset, this may include Canadian provinces, Mexican and US States, and counties or climate divisions of US states.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database, specifying an area name whose mpAreaTypes is 1 or 2 (mpGeophysical or mpContinental) has the effect of suppressing type 3 or higher boundaries within its borders even if the setting of mpFillBoundarySets would otherwise imply that they be drawn . For instance, setting mpOutlineSpecifiers to the value "Africa" would have the effect of suppressing national boundaries within the African continent. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: Geophysical 
mpOutlineDrawOrder (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when MapPlot area outlines are drawn relative to other elements of the plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw the area outlines before the standard draw phase; the lines will overlay MapPlot fill and grid or limb lines also drawn during the predraw phase but will underlie MapPlot labels and perimeter lines drawn during the predraw phase and anything drawn during the draw and postdraw phases.  Draw     Draw the area outlines during the standard draw; the lines will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw phase, as well as MapPlot fill and grid or limb lines drawn during the standard draw phase, but will underlie MapPlot labels and perimeter lines drawn during the draw phase and anything drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw the lines after the standard draw; the lines will overlay all MapPlot elements except for labels and perimeter lines drawn during the postdraw phase.  Default: PostDraw 
mpOutlineMaskingOn (MapPlot) 2.0.a034 and later. This boolean resource is the master switch for enabling the outline masking facility. If True, MapPlot enables outline masking, causing the boundaries of areas named in the mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers array to remain undrawn. If False, no masking is performed, regardless of the contents of mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers. For convenience, setting mpMaskOutlineSpecifiers causes mpOutlineMaskingOn to be set True, if it is not explicitly set otherwise in the same call. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: False 
mpOutlineOn (MapPlot) This boolean resource is the master switch for drawing of MapPlot area outlines. If True, the MapPlot enables drawing of map area outlines. Otherwise, these outlines will not appear, regardless of the setting of any other area-outline-related resources. However, note that this resource does not apply to MapPlot grid or limb lines or to the perimeter line. Default: True (False for some gsn_csm_xxxx routines) 
mpOutlineSpecifiers (MapPlot) You use the array resource mpOutlineSpecifiers to specify particular area outlines MapPlot is to draw by name. These areas are added to the basic outline area set specified using the resource mpOutlineBoundarySets. Note that the names from different MapPlot databases and datasets are not necessarily compatible. Therefore, if mpOutlineSpecifiers is non-NULL when you set mpDataBaseVersion and/or mpDataSetName to a different value, you are likely to encounter warning messages unless you also set mpOutlineSpecifiers using names compatible with the new database. You can retrieve a list of compatible names by getting the value of mpAreaNames. Case is not significant for mpOutlineSpecifiers string values. When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     In addition to the individual area names, you may include certain pre-defined groups of areas using a number of pre-defined string constants. Moreover, there is a substring matching facility that allows you to specify groups of areas sharing a common substring.  When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     The NullArea string constant is defined. Due to the hierarchical nature of this database, many area groupings occur as named entities in their own right. For instance, you can draw the small islands of the Pacific Ocean by including the string "Pacific Islands" as an element of mpOutlineSpecifiers. There is no substring matching facility.     2.0.a034 and later.     In addition to individual area names, you can specify subdivisions of certain areas (states, provinces, and counties) using pre-defined group names appended to the area name following a colon (':') character.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is ignored.  Default: NULL 
mpPerimDrawOrder (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when the perimeter line around the edge of the map projection is drawn relative to other elements of the plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw the perimeter before the standard draw phase; the perimeter overlays all other MapPlot elements drawn during the predraw phase except MapPlot labels but underlies anything drawn during the draw and postdraw phases.  Draw     Draw the perimeter during the standard draw; the perimeter overlays anything drawn during the predraw phase and any other MapPlot elements (except MapPlot labels) drawn during the draw phase but underlies anything drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw the perimeter after the standard draw; the perimeter overlays anything drawn during the predraw and draw phases and all other MapPlot elements (except MapPlot labels) drawn during the postdraw phase.  Default: Draw 
mpPerimLineColor (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of the color used to render the perimeter line around the edge of the map projection. Default: Foreground 
mpPerimLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the HLU index of a dash pattern used to render the perimeter line around the edge of the map projection. Default: SolidLine 
mpPerimLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to draw the perimeter line around the edge of the map projection. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. MapPlot sets the default value of mpPerimLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpPerimLineThicknessF (MapPlot) This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the edge of the map projection. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
mpPerimOn (MapPlot) This boolean resource determines whether the MapPlot object draws a perimeter line around the edge of the map projection. Depending on the setting of the MapTransformation resource mpEllipticalBoundary, this perimeter may have a rectangular or elliptical shape. Default: False 
mpPolyMode (MapTransformation) This resource takes three possible values: "StandardPoly", "FastPoly", and "AutoPoly". It allows you to set which method to use when adding polygons to a map plot. The default is "AutoPoly", which means that NCL decides which type of polygon to draw based on the great circle distance of each component line segment and on the polygon's GraphicStyle attributes. If the great circle distance of any component line segment is greater than 10 degress or if any fill pattern other than solid is in effect, then the "StandardPoly" method is used, which was always in effect in NCL versions 6.1.2 and earlier. Otherwise, the "FastPoly" method is used, which was introduced in NCL version 6.2.0. Default: AutoPoly 
mpProjection (MapTransformation) This resource of type NhlTProjection defines the projection used for the map transformation. There are several choices: Orthographic     Transform using an aziumthal orthographic projection.  Stereographic     Transform using an azimuthal stereographic projection.  LambertEqualArea     Transform using the azimuthal Lambert Equal-Area projection.  Gnomonic     Transform using the azimuthal gnomonic projection.  AzimuthalEquidistant     Transform using an azimuthal equidistant projection.  Satellite     Transform using an azimuthal satellite projection.  PseudoMollweide     Transform using a PseudoMollweide projection. Prior to version 5.1.0 this projection was specified simply as "Mollweide". However, a more correct implementation of the "Mollweide" projection has now been given that name, while the "PseudoMolleweide" projection is still available for backwards compatibility.  Mercator     Transform using the cylindrical Mercator projection.  CylindricalEquidistant     Transform using a cylindrical equidistant projection.  LambertConformal     Transform using the conical Lambert Conformal projection.  Robinson     Transform using a Robinson projection.  CylindricalEqualArea     Transform using a CylindricalEqualArea projection.  RotatedMercator     Transform using a RotatedMercator projection.  Aitoff (1.0 and later.)     Transform using a Aitoff projection.  Hammer (1.0 and later.)     Transform using a Hammer projection.  Mollweide (1.0 and later.)     Transform using a cylindrical Mollweide projection. Note that as of version 5.1.0 the original Mollweide-type projection has been replaced with an improved version that more correctly implements the projection. The original Mollweide-like projection is still available using the name "PseudoMollweide".  WinkelTripel (1.0 and later.)     Transform using a WinkelTripel projection.  Default: CylindricalEquidistant 
mpProvincialLineColor (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTColorIndex can be set using a named color string or an integer value. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the color used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the color used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is an another name for the mpUSStatesLineColor resource. The name has been updated to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: Foreground 
mpProvincialLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the index specifying the dash pattern used to render state or provincial boundary lines. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the dash pattern used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the dash pattern used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is another name for the mpUSStatesLineDashPattern resource, updated to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. p> Default: SolidLine 
mpProvincialLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to render state or provincial boundary outlines. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the segment length used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the segment length used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is another name for the mpUSStatesLineDashSegLenF resource, updated to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. MapPlot sets the default value of mpProvincialLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpProvincialLineThicknessF (MapPlot) This resource Sets the thickness of the lines used to render state or provincal boundary outlines. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the thickness used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the thickness used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is another name for the mpUSStatesLineThicknessF resource, updated to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
mpRelativeCenterLat (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value LatLon and mpRelativeCenterLat is set True, the resource mpCenterLatF becomes an offset in degrees from the latitude halfway between mpMinLatF and mpMaxLatF. That is, if mpCenterLatF is 0.0, the half point latitude will be the center of the projection. Default: False 
mpRelativeCenterLon (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value LatLon and mpRelativeCenterLon is set True, the resource mpCenterLonF becomes an offset in degrees from the longitude halfway between mpMinLonF and mpMaxLonF. That is, if mpCenterLonF is 0.0, the half point longitude will be the center of the projection. Default: False 
mpRightAngleF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Angles, this resource specifies the positive angle in degrees right from the center to the edge of the projection, or, if using a satellite projection, the displacement angle right from the satellite line of sight to the projection center. Note that direction of the line over which the angle is measured remains parallel to the top of the viewport, regardless of the rotation angle applied to the projection. mpRightAngleF has a maximum allowable value that varies depending on the projection. Default: 80.0 
mpRightCornerLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Corners, this resource specifies the latitude, in degrees, of the right corner point. Default: 0.0 
mpRightCornerLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Corners, this resource specifies the longitude, in degrees, of the right corner point. Default: 0.0 
mpRightMapPosF (MapTransformation) This read-only resource contains the coordinate of the right edge of the projected area in NDC space. Default: 1.0 
mpRightNDCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NDC, this resource specifies the right edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Device Coordinates. If mpRightNDCF is set to a value less than mpLeftNDCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. Since the relationship between the map projection area and NDC coordinates changes whenever the map limits are changed, as well as when the viewport area is moved or resized, MapTransformation resets the value of mpRightNDCF to the NDC value of the right edge of the projected area at the end of any update to the transformation. Default: <dynamic> 
mpRightNPCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NPC, this resource specifies the right edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Projection Coordinates. mpRightNPCF is constrained to values in the range 0.0 through 1.0. If mpRightNPCF is set to a value less than mpLeftNPCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. The value of mpRightNPCF is updated whenever the map limits are set using any of the map limit modes. Default: 1.0 
mpRightPointLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the latitude, in degrees, of a point along the right edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpRightPointLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the longitude, in degrees, of a point along the right edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpRightWindowF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Window, this resource specifies the value, in window coordinates, of the right edge of the projection. Default: 0.0 
mpSatelliteAngle1F (MapTransformation) When mpProjection is set to Satellite and mpSatelliteDistF has a value greater than 1.0, this resource specifies the angle in degrees between a line to the center of the earth and the line of sight (to which the projection plane is perpendicular). Default: 0.0 
mpSatelliteAngle2F (MapTransformation) This resource only has an effect when mpProjection is set to Satellite, mpSatelliteDistF has a value greater than 1.0, and mpSatelliteAngle1F has a non-zero value. Imagine a compass (the geometrical instrument) with its joint at the position of the satellite, its first leg extending to the center of the earth, and the second pointing in the direction of the line of sight. The second leg is longer than the first, so that it meets a plane through the center of the earth normal to the first leg. The angle in degrees between the two legs is SatelliteAngle1F. When SatelliteAngle2F has the value 0.0, a line drawn from the first leg of the compass to the second will appear horizontal and directed toward the right. Increasing values of SatelliteAngle2F correspond to counterclockwise rotations of the compass, (and hence, the line of sight) from this base position. Default: 0.0 
mpSatelliteDistF (MapTransformation) When mpProjection is set to Satellite, this resource specifies the distance in multiples of the earth's radius of the satellite at the view origin. If the value is 1.0 or less, the satellite projection is replaced by its limiting case: an orthographic projection. Default: 1.0 
mpShapeMode (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTMapShapeMode allows you to control whether the map projection preserves its intrinsic shape (aspect ratio), and in addition, if the aspect ratio is to be preserved, whether the MapPlot bounding box should be resized to fit the map projection extent exactly. It has three possible settings: FreeAspect     Do not preserve the map projection aspect ratio. The projected area is "stretched" along either the horizontal or the vertical View axis such that it fills the specified View area.  FixedAspectFitBB     Preserve the map projection aspect ratio. The projected area is made as large as possible and centered within the View area. Then MapPlot resizes its View area such that its perimeter matches the bounding box of the projected area.  FixedAspectNoFitBB     Preserve the map projection aspect ratio. The projected area is made as large as possible and centered within the View area. MapPlot does not resize its View area.  Default: FixedAspectFitBB 
mpSpecifiedFillColors (MapPlot) You may use this array resource to set explicitly the fill color of any MapPlot area specified by name in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array resource, overriding the usual method of determining an area's fill color based on its assigned area group numbers. The elements of the mpSpecifiedFillColors array correspond one-for-one to the elements of the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array. Depending on the setting of the boolean resource mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing, you control the level of indirection in the way MapPlot interprets the values in mpSpecifiedFillColors. If mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing is True, MapPlot treats the values of mpSpecifiedFillColors as HLU color indexes directly determining the fill color of the specified areas. Otherwise, MapPlot considers each value as a MapPlot group number that temporarily overrides the group numbers normally assigned to the area. In this case, MapPlot determines the HLU fill color by using this temporary group number as an index into the mpFillColors array. You may cause any element of the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array to retain its normal color by setting the corresponding element of mpSpecifiedFillColors to the special value NullColor (-1). If mpSpecifiedFillColors has fewer elements than mpFillAreaSpecifiers MapPlot sets all the extra elements of mpFillAreaSpecifiers using its normal scheme. If mpSpecifiedFillColors has more elements, MapPlot ignores them. If any of the elements of mpSpecifiedFillColors are invalid, MapPlot issues a warning and assigns the area a color using the normal scheme. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: <dynamic> 
mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing (MapPlot) This boolean resource determines whether the values contained in the specified fill attribute array resources (mpSpecifiedFillColors, mpSpecifiedFillPatterns, and mpSpecifiedFillScales) directly specify the attribute value, or whether they specify an area group number used as an index into the regular fill attribute array resources (mpFillColors, mpFillPatterns, and mpFillScales). When mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing is set True, the values of mpSpecifiedFillColors elements represent HLU color indexes, the values of mpSpecifiedFillPatterns elements represent HLU pattern indexes, and the values of mpSpecifiedFillPatterns elements represent fill pattern scaling factors. Otherwise, the elements of these arrays are converted into integers that represent area group numbers. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: True 
mpSpecifiedFillPatterns (MapPlot) You may use this array resource to set explicitly the fill pattern of any MapPlot area specified by name in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array resource, overriding the usual method of determining an area's fill pattern based on its assigned area group numbers. The elements of the mpSpecifiedFillPatterns array correspond one-for-one to the elements of the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array. Depending on the setting of the boolean resource mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing, you control the level of indirection in the way MapPlot interprets the values in mpSpecifiedFillPatterns. If mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing is True, MapPlot treats the values of mpSpecifiedFillPatterns as HLU pattern indexes directly determining the fill pattern of the specified areas. Otherwise, MapPlot considers each value as a MapPlot group number that temporarily overrides the group numbers normally assigned to the area. In this case, MapPlot determines the HLU fill pattern by using this temporary group number as an index into the mpFillPatterns array. You may cause any element of the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array to retain its normal pattern by setting the corresponding element of mpSpecifiedFillPatterns to the special value NullFill (-1). If mpSpecifiedFillPatterns has fewer elements than mpFillAreaSpecifiers, MapPlot sets all the extra elements of mpFillAreaSpecifiers using its normal scheme. If mpSpecifiedFillPatterns has more elements, MapPlot ignores them. If any of the elements of mpSpecifiedFillPatterns are invalid, MapPlot issues a warning and assigns the area a pattern using the normal scheme. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: <dynamic> 
mpSpecifiedFillPriority (MapPlot) When using the Ncarg4_0 database:     Based on the setting of this resource of type NhlTSpecifiedFillPriority, MapPlot decides how to choose a group number for indexing into the regular fill attribute arrays for areas specified in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers resource. The group number is only used to determine fill attributes that have not been specified explicitly using the specified fill attribute arrays. The choices are as follows:     GeophysicalPriority         Use group numbers from the mpFixedAreaGroups array as an index into the fill attribute arrays.      PoliticalPriority         Use group numbers from the mpDynamicAreaGroups array as an index into the fill attribute arrays.      You can reverse the sense of the general fill priority value for individual named areas in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers resource by prefixing the name string with the exclamation point character ('!'). When using the Ncarg4_1 database:     The mpSpecifiedFillPriority resource is not supported.  When using the RANGS database:     This resource is ignored.  Default: GeophysicalPriority 
mpSpecifiedFillScales (MapPlot) You may use this array resource to explicitly set the fill pattern scale factor of any MapPlot area specified by name in the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array resource, overriding the usual method of determining an area's fill scale based on its assigned area group numbers. The elements of the mpSpecifiedFillScales array correspond one-for-one to the elements of the mpFillAreaSpecifiers array. Depending on the setting of the boolean resource mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing, you control the level of indirection in the way MapPlot interprets the values in mpSpecifiedFillScales. If mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing is True, MapPlot treats the values of mpSpecifiedFillScales as floating point values directly determining the fill scale of the specified areas. Otherwise, MapPlot converts each number into an integer and treats it as a MapPlot group number that temporarily overrides the group numbers normally assigned to the area. In this case, MapPlot determines the fill scale value by using this temporary group number as an index into the mpFillScales array. You may cause any element of the FillAreaSpecifiers array to retain its normal fill scale value by setting the corresponding element of mpSpecifiedFillScales to the special value 0.0. If mpSpecifiedFillScales has fewer elements than mpFillAreaSpecifiers, MapPlot sets all the extra elements of mpFillAreaSpecifiers using its normal scheme. If mpSpecifiedFillScales has more elements, MapPlot ignores them. If any of the elements of mpSpecifiedFillScales are invalid, MapPlot issues a warning and assigns the area a scale using the normal scheme. Note that a kludge is required if mpSpecifiedFillDirectIndexing is set False, so that you are indexing into the mpFillScales array using group numbers, and you want to specify that a fill scale be determined by indexing into element 0 of mpFillScales. You would need to set the element of mpSpecifiedFillScales using a number larger than 0.0 but less than 1.0. If you set the value to 0.0, it would be interpreted as the special value causing MapPlot to use its "normal" method of determining the fill scale for the area. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: <dynamic> 
mpTopAngleF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Angles, this resource specifies the positive angle in degrees up from the center to the edge of the projection, or, if using a satellite projection, the displacement angle up from the satellite line of sight to the projection center. Note that direction of the line over which the angle is measured remains parallel to the left edge of the viewport, regardless of the rotation angle applied to the projection. mpTopAngleF has a maximum allowable value that varies depending on the projection. Default: 80.0 
mpTopMapPosF (MapTransformation) This read-only resource contains the coordinate of the top edge of the projected area in NDC space. Default: 1.0 
mpTopNDCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NDC, this resource specifies the top edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Device Coordinates. If mpTopNDCF is set to a value less than mpBottomNDCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. Since the relationship between the map projection area and NDC coordinates changes whenever the map limits are changed, as well as when the viewport area is moved or resized, MapTransformation resets the value of mpTopNDCF to the NDC value of the top edge of the projected area at the end of any update to the transformation. Default: <dynamic> 
mpTopNPCF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value NPC, this resource specifies the top edge of the limiting rectangle in Normalized Projection Coordinates. mpTopNPCF is constrained to values in the range 0.0 through 1.0. If mpTopNPCF is set to a value less than mpBottomNPCF, a warning is issued and the values are exchanged. The value of mpTopNPCF is updated whenever the map limits are set using any of the map limit modes. Default: 1.0 
mpTopPointLatF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the latitude, in degrees, of a point along the top edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpTopPointLonF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Points, this resource specifies the longitude, in degrees, of a point along the top edge of the limiting rectangle. Default: 0.0 
mpTopWindowF (MapTransformation) When mpLimitMode has the value Window, this resource specifies the value, in window coordinates, of the top edge of the projection. Default: 0.0 
mpUSStateLineColor (MapPlot) This resource of type NhlTColorIndex can be set using a named color string or an integer value. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the color used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the color used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is an another name for the mpProvincialLineColor resource, which has been added to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: Foreground 
mpUSStateLineDashPattern (MapPlot) This resource sets the index specifying the dash pattern used to render state or provincial boundary lines. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the dash pattern used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the dash pattern used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is another name for the mpProvincialLineDashPattern resource, which has been added to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: SolidLine 
mpUSStateLineDashSegLenF (MapPlot) This resource specifies the length of each segment of the dash patterns used to render state or provincial boundary outlines. It is the length in NDC before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the MapPlot object. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the segment length used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the segment length used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is another name for the mpProvincialLineDashSegLenF resource, which has been added to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. MapPlot sets the default value of mpProvincialLineDashSegLenF dynamically based on the ratio of the actual plot viewport width to a reference viewport width of 0.6 and a reference dash segment length of 0.15. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
mpUSStateLineThicknessF (MapPlot) This resource Sets the thickness of the lines used to render state or provincal boundary outlines. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_1 (MediumRes) it specifies the thickness used to render interior provincial or state boundary outlines for a selected number of countries. It has no effect on boundary lines that are coincident with geographical boundaries or on inland water bodies that border or are enclosed within a state or province. When mpDataBaseVersion is set to Ncarg4_0 (LowRes) it specifies the thickness used to render state boundary outlines for the Conterminous United States and a few nearby islands. In this case, it also controls the color of the geophysical boundaries of the United States including inland water bodies, such as the Great Lakes, that border the country as a whole. This resource is another name for the mpProvincialLineThicknessF resource, updated to reflect its more universal applicability. When using the RANGS database this resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
pmAnnoManagers Each element of this read-only array resource contains the id of the AnnoManager object created to control the View annotation identified by the corresponding element of the pmAnnoViews array. Whenever pmAnnoViews is modified, pmAnnoManagers is updated to match. Default: NULL 
pmAnnoViews This array resource contains the ids of the View objects added as annotations by the user to the plot object. If you set this resource, the contents of the existing array are replaced. However, if you add a single annotation using the NhlAddAnnotation function, the id of the view is appended to the end of the existing array. When a view becomes an annotation, the PlotManager creates an AnnoManager object you can use to control the location and/or the size of the object relative to the base plot's viewport or data coordinate space. Once a view has a controlling AnnoManager, it can no longer be drawn directly. Instead it is drawn automatically whenever you draw the primary base plot of which it is a plot member. When you remove a single annotation using the NhlRemoveAnnotation function, the remaining View ids retain their order within the array, but are moved to fill in the space that had been occupied by the id of the view removed. The result is an array containing one fewer element. If you destroy a View object currently used as an annotation, the effect on the pmAnnoViews resource is the same as if you had removed it using NhlRemoveAnnotation. Default: NULL 
pmLabelBarDisplayMode This resource of type NhlTAnnotationDisplayMode determines whether the plot object displays a LabelBar object. It has four settings: NoCreate     If pmLabelBarDisplayMode has the value NoCreate when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does not create a LabelBar object. The plot object will never be able to display a LabelBar belonging to itself during its lifetime, and attempts to change the value of pmLabelBarDisplayMode later will fail with an error message. However, as a base plot it still would be able display a LabelBar object belonging to an added overlay plot.  Never     If pmLabelBarDisplayMode has the value Never when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does create a LabelBar object, but it is not drawn.  Always     If pmLabelBarDisplayMode has the value Always when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a LabelBar object that will be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the LabelBar object itself.  Conditional     If pmLabelBarDisplayMode has the value Conditional when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a LabelBar that may be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the LabelBar object itself. If the plot object becomes an overlay, the LabelBar will be displayed only if no other LabelBar objects belonging to other plots in the overlay sequence have already been displayed.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: NoCreate (Always for some gsn_csm_xxxx routines that turn on contour or vector fill) 
pmLabelBarHeightF This resource specifies the desired height of the LabelBar object in NDC units. Note that the actual height of the LabelBar may vary somewhat from the desired height, depending on the setting of certain resources belonging to the LabelBar. If not set explicitly, the value of this resource adjusts dynamically in proportion to changes of the viewport height. Default: 0.6 (for a viewport height of 0.6) 
pmLabelBarKeepAspect While the boolean resource pmLabelBarKeepAspect is True, the PlotManager ensures that the LabelBar object keeps its initial shape (aspect ratio), however you may modify its size resources or the size and/or shape of the base plot. Default: False 
pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the LabelBar object annotation orthogonal to the current pmLabelBarSide. Unless the value ofpmLabelBarZone is 1, it is directed away from the center of the viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the LabelBar object annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.02 
pmLabelBarParallelPosF pmLabelBarParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the LabelBar object annotation parallel to the current pmLabelBarSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the LabelBar object annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.5 
pmLabelBarSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the LabelBar object in relation to the sides of the plot object's viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the LabelBar object in a manner consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources pmLabelBarParallelPosF and pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of the LabelBar object resource lbJustification appropriately. There are four settings that behave as follows, unless pmLabelBarZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     The PlotManager locates the LabelBar annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLabelBarParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. lbJustification is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.  Bottom     The PlotManager locates the LabelBar annotation relative to a line paralleling the bottom viewport boundary. pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLabelBarParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. lbJustification is constrained to NhlTOPRIGHT, NhlTOPCENTER, or NhlTOPLEFT.  Right     The PlotManager locates the LabelBar annotation relative to a line paralleling the right viewport boundary. pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLabelBarParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. lbJustification is constrained to TopLeft, CenterLeft, or BottomLeft.  Left     The PlotManager locates the LabelBar annotation relative to a line paralleling the left viewport boundary. pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLabelBarParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. lbJustification is constrained to TopRight, CenterRight, or BottomRight.  If pmLabelBarZone is set to 0, the PlotManager locates the LabelBar relative to the viewport center. If pmLabelBarZone is 1, the direction of the pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the pmLabelBarZone is either 0 or 1, lbJustification is not constrained, and pmLabelBarOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
pmLabelBarWidthF This resource specifies the desired width of the LabelBar object in NDC units. Note that the actual width of the LabelBar may vary somewhat from the desired width, depending on the setting of certain resources belonging to the LabelBar. If not set explicitly, the value of this resource adjusts dynamically in proportion to changes of the viewport width. Default: 0.15 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
pmLabelBarZone This resource specifies the annotation zone used to determine the location of the LabelBar object. The PlotManager manages the location of LabelBar object according to the rules of the PlotManager Location Control Model. Default: 6 
pmLegendDisplayMode This resource of type NhlTAnnotationDisplayMode determines whether the plot object displays a Legend object. It has four settings: NoCreate     If pmLegendDisplayMode has the value NoCreate when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does not create a Legend object. The plot object will never be able to display a Legend belonging to itself during its lifetime, and attempts to change the value of pmLegendDisplayMode later will fail with an error message. However, as a base plot it still would be able display a Legend object belonging to an added overlay plot.  Never     If pmLegendDisplayMode has the value Never when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does create a Legend object, but it is not drawn.  Always     If pmLegendDisplayMode has the value Always when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a Legend object that will be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the Legend object itself.  Conditional     If pmLegendDisplayMode has the value Conditional when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a Legend that may be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the Legend object itself. If the plot object becomes an overlay, the Legend will be displayed only if no other Legend objects belonging to other plots in the overlay sequence have already been displayed.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: NoCreate 
pmLegendHeightF This resource specifies the desired height of the Legend object in NDC units. Note that the actual height of the Legend may vary somewhat from the desired height, depending on the setting of certain resources belonging to the Legend. If not set explicitly, the value of this resource adjusts dynamically in proportion to changes of the viewport height. Default: 0.18 (for a viewport height of 0.6) 
pmLegendKeepAspect While the boolean resource pmLegendKeepAspect is True, the PlotManager ensures that the Legend object keeps its initial shape (aspect ratio), however you may modify its size resources or the size and/or shape of the base plot. Default: False 
pmLegendOrthogonalPosF pmLegendOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the Legend object annotation orthogonal to the current pmLegendSide. Unless the value ofpmLegendZone is 1, it is directed away from the center of the viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the Legend object annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.02 
pmLegendParallelPosF pmLegendParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the Legend object annotation parallel to the current pmLegendSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the Legend object annotation in a manner consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.5 
pmLegendSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the Legend object in relation to the sides of the plot object's viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the Legend object in a manner consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources, pmLegendParallelPosF and pmLegendOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of the Legend object resource lgJustification appropriately. There are four settings that behave as follows, unless pmLegendZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     The PlotManager locates the Legend annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. pmLegendOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLegendParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. lgJustification is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.  Bottom     The PlotManager locates the Legend annotation relative to a line paralleling the bottom viewport boundary. pmLegendOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLegendParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. lgJustification is constrained to TopRight, TopCenter, or TopLeft.  Right     The PlotManager locates the Legend annotation relative to a line paralleling the right viewport boundary. pmLegendOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLegendParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. lgJustification is constrained to TopLeft, CenterLeft, or BottomLeft.  Left     The PlotManager locates the Legend annotation relative to a line paralleling the left viewport boundary. pmLegendOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. pmLegendParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. lgJustification is constrained to TopRight, CenterRight, or BottomRight.  If pmLegendZone is set to 0, The PlotManager locates the Legend relative to the viewport center. If pmLegendZone is 1, the direction of the pmLegendOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the pmLegendZone is either 0 or 1, lgJustification is not constrained, and pmLegendOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
pmLegendWidthF This resource specifies the desired width of the Legend object in NDC units. Note that the actual width of the Legend may vary somewhat from the desired width, depending on the setting of certain resources belonging to the Legend. If not set explicitly, the value of this resource adjusts dynamically in proportion to changes of the viewport width. Default: 0.55 (for a viewport width of 0.6) 
pmLegendZone This resource specifies the annotation zone used to determine the location of the Legend object. The PlotManager manages the location of Legend object according to the rules of the PlotManager Location Control Model. Default: 7 
pmOverlaySequenceIds This read-only resource can be used to get an array of object ids comprised of the transforms in the overlay sequence. The elements of the array will be ordered according to the overlay sequence, starting with the base plot. Default: NULL 
pmTickMarkDisplayMode This resource of type NhlTAnnotationDisplayMode determines whether the plot object displays a TickMark object. It has four settings: NoCreate     If pmTickMarkDisplayMode has the value NoCreate when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does not create a TickMark object. The plot object will never be able to display a TickMark belonging to itself during its lifetime, and attempts to change the value of pmTickMarkDisplayMode later will fail with an error message. However, as a base plot it still would be able display a TickMark object belonging to an added overlay plot.  Never     If pmTickMarkDisplayMode has the value Never when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does create a TickMark object, but it is not drawn.  Always     If pmTickMarkDisplayMode has the value Always when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a TickMark object that will be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the TickMark object itself.  Conditional     If pmTickMarkDisplayMode has the value Conditional when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a TickMark that may be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the TickMark object itself. If the plot object becomes an overlay, the TickMark will be displayed only if no other TickMark objects belonging to other plots in the overlay sequence have already been displayed.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     MapPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: NoCreate 
pmTickMarkZone This resource specifies the annotation zone used to determine the location of the TickMark object. Since the TickMark object is by its nature confined to a bounding box very near the PlotManager plot viewport, its zone must be set to 2 or less. Attempts to set the value of pmTickMarkZone to a value greater than 2 result in an error message; the resource will be reset to the default value. Note that the PlotManager object's treatment of the TickMark object does not completely follow the rules of the PlotManager Location Control Model. Default: 2 
pmTitleDisplayMode This resource of type NhlTAnnotationDisplayMode determines whether the plot object displays a Title object. It has four settings: NoCreate     If pmTitleDisplayMode has the value NoCreate when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does not create a Title object. The plot object will never be able to display a Title belonging to itself during its lifetime, and attempts to change the value of pmTitleDisplayMode later will fail with an error message. However, as a base plot it still would be able display a Title object belonging to an added overlay plot.  Never     If pmTitleDisplayMode has the value Never when the plot object is created, the PlotManager does create a Title object, but it is not drawn.  Always     If pmTitleDisplayMode has the value Always when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a Title object that will be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the Title object itself.  Conditional     If pmTitleDisplayMode has the value Conditional when the plot object is created, the PlotManager creates a Title that may be drawn, assuming it meets all conditions of displayability set by the Title object itself. If the plot object becomes an overlay, the Title will be displayed only if no other Title objects belonging to other transforms in the overlay sequence have already been displayed.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: NoCreate 
pmTitleZone This resource specifies the annotation zone used to determine the location of the Title object. Note that the PlotManager object's treatment of the Title object does not completely follow the rules of the PlotManager Location Control Model. Default: 4 
prGraphicStyle This resource specifies the id of a GraphicStyle object used to determine the attributes of the the graphics primitive. If set to NullObjId a default graphicstyle will apply to the primitive. This may be either the default Workstation graphicstyle or a graphicstyle determined in some other way. Default: NullObjId 
prPolyType This resource of type NhlTPolyType specifies the type of the graphic primitive. Currently there are three choices: Polyline     The graphics primitive will be rendered as a series of connected lines. You define the line attributes by setting resources whose names begin with gsLine... in the associated graphic style object.  Polygon     The graphics primitive will be rendered as an edge consisting of closed series of connected lines enclosing a filled area. You define the edge attributes by setting resources whose names begin with gsEdge... in the associated graphic style object. Likewise, you define the fill attributes by setting resources whose names begin with gsFill....  Polymarker     The graphics primitive will be rendered as a series of marker symbols drawn at each of the coordinate points. You define the marker attributes by setting resources whose names begin with gsMarker... in the associated graphic style object.  Default: Polyline 
prXArray This array resource specifies the data space X coordinates of the points that define the graphic primitive. Default: NULL 
prYArray This array resource specifies the data space Y coordinates of the points that define the graphic primitive. Default: NULL 
sfCopyData (MeshScalarField) The boolean resource sfCopyData allows you to control whether the MeshScalarField object always copies its array resources into a private memory area. If you set sfCopyData False, MeshScalarField will try to avoid making copies of the following resources:     sfDataArray     sfXArray     sfYArray     sfElementNodes     sfXCellBounds     sfYCellBounds  You will then be responsible for managing the contents of the variables used to set these resources for the lifetime of the MeshScalarField. In return, you will save some dynamic memory space, which may be important if you have very large datasets. Note that a number of circumstances require MeshScalarField to copy the data regardless. These include supplying data of any type other than NhlTInteger for sfElementNodes or NhlTFloat for any of the other resources. Default: True 
sfCopyData (ScalarField) The boolean resource sfCopyData allows you to control whether the ScalarField object always copies the elements of the sfDataArray into a private memory area. If you set sfCopyData False, ScalarField will not copy the sfXArray or the sfYArray data and will try to avoid making a copy of the sfDataArray data. You are then responsible for ensuring that the data memory locations for these arrays are preserved intact for the lifetime of the ScalarField. In return, you save some dynamic memory space. Note that a number of circumstances require ScalarField to copy the data regardless. These include supplying data of any type other than NhlTFloat, requesting that the data dimensions be exchanged, or setting a stride value greater than 1 in either the X or the Y dimension. Also, if you specify a data array subset and one or both of the coordinate array resources (sfXArray and/or sfYArray) is non-NULL, copies are made of the subsetted part of the coordinate array. Default: True 
sfDataArray (MeshScalarField) For the MeshScalarField, this resource specifies a one-dimensional array containing the data value at each node of a set of points used to define a two-dimensional scalar field mesh. There is no default for this resource, and along with the node location resources sfXArray and sfYArray, it must be specified in order to create a MeshScalarField object successfully. There are three ways a triangular mesh can be created from the data nodes, depending on the resources you provide to the MeshScalarField:     You may set the sfElementNodes resource to specify explicitly a set of triangles.     You may set sfXCellBounds and sfYCellBounds to specify the vertices of cells surrounding the data locations. The triangles defining the mesh will be deduced by sorting and matching vertices from adjacent cell boundaries.     You may specify no additional information, in which case a Delauney triangulation of the points will be calculated in the projection plane, using Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle package. This option has the following caveat: MeshScalarField currently has no way of communicating the mesh boundaries to the Triangle package. In practice, this means that concave boundary areas of the mesh will be poorly represented.  Although the MeshScalarField object always converts the data into type NhlTFloat before passing it along to MeshScalarField receiver objects, it accepts data arrays containing data of any of the following types:     NhlTByte     NhlTCharacter     NhlTShort     NhlTInteger     NhlTLong     NhlTFloat     NhlTDouble  Default: None (must be specified) 
sfDataArray (ScalarField) This resource specifies a two-dimensional array containing the data comprising a scalar field. There is no default for this resource, and it must be specified in order to create a ScalarField object successfully. The faster varying dimension (second dimension in C or NCL, first dimension in Fortran) is assumed to align with the X or horizontal axis of the grid coordinate system. However, you may exchange the dimensions of the array by appropriately setting the resource, sfExchangeDimensions. Although the ScalarField object always converts the data into type NhlTFloat before passing it along to ScalarField receiver objects, it accepts data arrays containing data of any of the following types:     NhlTByte     NhlTCharacter     NhlTShort     NhlTInteger     NhlTLong     NhlTFloat     NhlTDouble  Default: NULL 
sfDataMaxV (MeshScalarField) By default the MeshScalarField object sets sfDataMaxV to the largest value in the data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, MeshScalarField does not process the array to find the maximum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the maximum value. You may set sfDataMaxV using any of the data types MeshScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
sfDataMaxV (ScalarField) By default the ScalarField object sets sfDataMaxV to the largest value in the data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, ScalarField does not process the array to find the maximum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the maximum value. You may set sfDataMaxV using any of the data types ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
sfDataMinV (MeshScalarField) By default the MeshScalarField object sets sfDataMinV to the smallest value in the data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, MeshScalarField does not process the array to find the minimum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the minimum value. You may set sfDataMinV using any of the data types MeshScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
sfDataMinV (ScalarField) By default the ScalarField object sets sfDataMinV to the smallest value in the data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, ScalarField does not process the array to find the minimum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the minimum value. You may set sfDataMinV using any of the data types ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
sfElementNodes (MeshScalarField) If you have a pre-defined triangular mesh, you can specify how the nodes are connected to form triangles by setting the sfElementNodes resource with a two-dimensional array. This array has an element along the first dimension for each triangle in the mesh. The second dimension has 3 elements, one for each vertex of the triangle. The value of each element is the index of an element of the sfDataArray, sfXArray, and sfYArray resources. Taken together these resources specify a location and data value for each vertex of the triangle. You can specify the starting index used to number the vertex nodes with the sfFirstNodeIndex resource. Default: NULL 
sfExchangeDimensions (ScalarField) When this boolean resource is set True, ScalarField exchanges the dimensions of the data array on delivery to any receiving object. Resouces associated with the X-Axis (the fast-varying dimension) are applied to the Y-Axis (the slow-varying dimension) of the output data and vice-versa. Whenever sfExchangeDimensions is True, ScalarField must copy the data array, regardless of the setting of the sfCopyData resource. Default: False 
sfFirstNodeIndex (MeshScalarField) If sfElementNodes is set, this resource specifies the value used to indicate the first node index, normally 0 for NCL or C style array indexing, or 1 for Fortran style array indexing. Default: 0 
sfMissingValueV (MeshScalarField) If you set sfMissingValueV to a non-NULL value, MeshScalarField treats occurrences of its value in the data array as representing an undefined value. If left unset, MeshScalarField assumes that all values in the data array are valid. You may set sfMissingValueV using any of the data types MeshScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. Default: NULL 
sfMissingValueV (ScalarField) If you set sfMissingValueV to a non-NULL value, ScalarField treats occurrences of its value in the data array as representing an undefined value. If left unset, ScalarField assumes that all values in the data array are valid. You may set sfMissingValueV using any of the data types ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. Default: NULL 
sfXArray (MeshScalarField) For a MeshScalarField, sfXArray is a required resource and must be a one-dimensional array containing the same number of elements as sfDataArray. Each element of sfXArray specifies the location along the X Axis of the corresponding element of sfDataArray. You can specify sfXArray using an array of any of the types allowed for sfDataArray. Default: None (must be specified) 
sfXArray (ScalarField) If sfXArray is NULL, the coordinates of the X (faster-varying) axis of the data grid are assumed to be regularly spaced, and the endpoints are determined by the values of sfXCStartV and sfXCEndV. If sfXArray is set using a 1D array, its values represent sequential coordinate locations along the X-Axis (the faster-varying dimension) of the data grid. If the array contains the same number of elements as the data array dimension, its elements specify data grid cell centers. If it contains one more element, its elements specify data grid cell boundaries. ScalarField requires the coordinate array values to increase or decrease monotonically. If the coordinate array input does not have the right number of elements or is non-monotonic, ScalarField issues a warning restores sfXArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. If the input array is valid, ScalarField replaces the current value of sfXCStartV with the value of the first element of sfXArray, and the current value of sfXCEndV with the value of the last element. If sfXArray is set using a 2D array, it must have the same dimension sizes as sfYArray. Each element specifies the location along the X-Axis of a single data grid cell center or boundary. If sfXArray has the same dimension sizes as the data grid, the elements specify the grid cell centers for corresponding elements of the data grid. If both dimension sizes are one greater than the corresponding dimensions of the data grid, the elements specify the locations of the corners of the cell boundaries. Using NCL notation, for a data grid cell element (i,j): coordinate array element (i,j) locates the bottom-left corner, (i+1,j) locates the top-left corner, (i,j+1) locates the bottom-right corner, and (i+1,j+1) locates the top-right corner. For 2D coordinates, there is no requirement that the coordinates be monotonic. However, if the coordinates provided are not well-ordered as expected by the 2D-coordinate transformation routines, errors will occur when the Draw method is called. If the array does not contain valid dimension sizes, ScalarField issues a warning and restores sfXArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. You can specify sfXArray using a one or two dimensional array of any of the types allowed for sfDataArray. V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
sfXCActualEndF (MeshScalarField) This is a get-only resource that is set to the maximum value of sfXArray. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCActualEndF (ScalarField) When an ending location for a subset of the data is specified using sfXCEndSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. ScalarField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. In this case, the read-only resource sfXCActualEndF is set to the value of the actual ending location of the data subset along the X Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, sfXCActualEndF has the same value as sfXCEndSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCActualStartF (MeshScalarField) This is a get-only resource that is set to the minimum value of sfXArray. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCActualStartF (ScalarField) When a starting location for a subset of the data is specified using sfXCStartSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. In this case, ScalarField selects a beginning index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. The read-only resource sfXCActualStartF is set to the value of the actual starting location of the data subset along the X Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, sfXCActualStartF has the same value as sfXCStartSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCEndIndex (ScalarField) This resource specifies the larger of two indexes along the X-Axis data dimension. Valid values range from one greater than the value of sfXCStartIndex to one less than the size of the dimension. It is one of four resources used to specify a rectangular subset of the data using array indexes. This is the only form of subsetting ScalarField supports when sfXArray and sfYArray are set using 2D coordinate arrays, Unless sfXArray is set with a 2D array, explicitly setting sfXCEndSubsetV overrides any value set for sfXCEndIndex and causes it to be set to the smallest array index value such that the requested data coordinate location is included within the subset. Otherwise, if you set sfXCEndIndex, sfXCEndSubsetV will be set based on its value. sfXCEndIndex retains its value when the data array changes, unless the X-Axis dimension size also changes. In this case, assuming neither sfXCEndSubsetV nor sfXCEndIndex is explicitly set at the same time, sfXCEndIndex is set to the size of the X-Axis dimension minus one. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCEndSubsetV (ScalarField) sfXCEndSubsetV specifies the ending location along the X Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data array. It should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of sfXCStartV and sfXCEndV. If it is outside the coordinate extent, ScalarField issues a warning and sets it to the value of sfXCEndV. If the values of sfXCStartSubsetV and sfXCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by sfXCStartV and sfXCEndV, ScalarField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for sfXCEndSubsetV:     at initialization or when the X-Axis dimension size changes, if sfXCEndIndex is not set, sfXCEndSubsetV takes the value of sfXCEndV;     else if sfXCEndIndex is set, or there is a change to sfXCStartV, sfXCEndV or sfXArray, sfXCEndSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of sfXCEndIndex;     else sfXCEndSubsetV retains its current value.  Since the data array grid consists of data located at discrete points, the location specified by sfXCEndSubsetV might well fall between two data points. In this case, ScalarField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. Get the value of the read-only resource sfXCActualEndF in order to find the exact end of the subset along the X Axis. You may set sfXCEndSubsetV using any of the data types that ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If sfXArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfXCEndSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, sfXCEndSubsetV is set to the maximum value found within the specified subset of sfXArray. Otherwise sfXCEndSubsetV is set to the same value as sfXCEndV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCEndV (ScalarField) Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the X Axis of the last element of the fast-varying dimension of the data.If the array resource sfXArray is NULL, you can set sfXCEndV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If sfXCStartV is greater than sfXCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the X Axis is opposite the direction of the positive X Axis. If sfXArray is NULL and sfXCEndV is not specified, ScalarField sets sfXCEndV to the size of the fast-varying data dimension minus one. You may set sfXCEndV using any of the data types ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If you set sfXArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfXCEndV. If sfXArray is one-dimensional, sfXCEndV is set to the value of its last element. If sfXArray is two-dimensional, sfXCStartV is set to the maximum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCStartIndex (ScalarField) This resource specifies the smaller of two indexes along the X-Axis dimension. Valid values range from 0 to one less than the value of sfXCEndIndex. It is one of four resources used to specify a rectangular subset of the data using array indexes. This is the only form of subsetting ScalarField supports when sfXArray and sfYArray are set using 2D coordinate arrays, Unless sfXArray is set with a 2D array, explicitly setting sfXCStartSubsetV overrides any value set for sfXCStartIndex and causes it to be set to the largest array index value such that the requested data coordinate location is included within the subset. Otherwise, if you set sfXCStartIndex, sfXCStartSubsetV will be set based on its value. sfXCStartIndex retains its value when the data array changes, unless the X-Axis dimension size also changes. In this case, assuming neither sfXCStartSubsetV nor sfXCStartIndex is explicitly set at the same time, sfXCStartIndex is set to 0. Default: 0 
sfXCStartSubsetV (ScalarField) sfXCStartSubsetV specifies the starting location along the X Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data array. It should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of sfXCStartV and sfXCEndV. If it is outside the coordinate extent, ScalarField issues a warning and sets it to the value of sfXCStartV. If the values of sfXCStartSubsetV and sfXCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by sfXCStartV and sfXCEndV, ScalarField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for sfXCStartSubsetV:     at initialization or when the X-Axis dimension size changes, if sfXCStartIndex is not set, sfXCStartSubsetV takes the value of sfXCStartV;     else if sfXCStartIndex is set, or there is a change to sfXCStartV, sfXCEndV or sfXArray, sfXCStartSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of sfXCStartIndex;     else sfXCStartSubsetV retains its current value.  Since the data array grid consists of data located at discrete points, the location specified by sfXCStartSubsetV might well fall between two data points. In this case, ScalarField selects a beginning index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. Get the value of the read-only resource sfXCActualStartF in order to find the exact start of the subset along the X Axis. You may set sfXCStartSubsetV using any of the data types that ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If sfXArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfXCStartSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, sfXCStartSubsetV is set to the minimum value found within the specified subset of sfXArray. Otherwise sfXCStartSubsetV is set to the same value as sfXCStartV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCStartV (ScalarField) Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the X Axis of the first element of the fast-varying dimension of the data. If the array resource sfXArray is NULL, you can set sfXCStartV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If sfXCStartV is greater than sfXCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the X Axis is opposite the direction of the positive X Axis. If sfXArray is NULL and sfXCStartV is not specified, ScalarField sets sfXCStartV to the value 0. You may set sfXCStartV using any of the data types ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If you set sfXArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfXCStartV. If sfXArray is one-dimensional, sfXCStartV is set to the value of its first element. If sfXArray is two-dimensional, sfXCStartV is set to the minimum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
sfXCStride (ScalarField) When sfXCStride has a value greater than one, the ScalarField object creates a new array containing only columns indexed along the X dimension by successive multiples (starting with 0) of the sfXCStride value added to the starting index. The starting index is based on the current state of the applicable subsetting resources; it is 0 if no array subsetting is in effect. The resulting array is passed to the receiving plot object. Note that if ending index minus starting index is not an exact multiple of the sfXCStride value, then the data coordinate range may be reduced slightly. The sfXCStride resource is currently ignored if sfXArray and sfYArray contain 2D coordinate arrays. Default: 1 
sfXCellBounds (MeshScalarField) Set this resource and sfYCellBounds with two dimensional arrays to specify the boundaries of the cells surrounding each data node. The first dimension must have the same number of elements as sfDataArray. The second dimension should be large enough to contain all the vertices of the polygons that define the cell boundaries. This resource specifies the locations along the X Axis of the vertices of the bounding cells. If all the cells do not have the same number of vertices, the value of the last valid vertex should be repeated for the extra elements of cells with fewer vertices. Given the resources sfXCellBounds and sfYCellBounds, the triangles defining the mesh will be deduced by sorting and matching the vertices from adjoining cell boundaries. Default: NULL 
sfYArray (MeshScalarField) For a MeshScalarField, sfYArray is a required resource and must be a one-dimensional array containing the same number of elements as sfDataArray. Each element of sfYArray specifies the location along the Y Axis of the corresponding element of sfDataArray. You can specify sfYArray using an array of any of the types allowed for sfDataArray. Default: None (must be specified) 
sfYArray (ScalarField) If sfYArray is NULL, the coordinates of the Y (slower-varying) axis of the data grid are assumed to be regularly spaced, and the endpoints are determined by the values of sfYCStartV and sfYCEndV. If sfYArray is set using a 1D array, its values represent sequential coordinate locations along the Y-Axis (the slower-varying dimension) of the data grid. If the array contains the same number of elements as the data array dimension, its elements specify data grid cell centers. If it contains one more element, its elements specify data grid cell boundaries. ScalarField requires the coordinate array values to increase or decrease monotonically. If the coordinate array input does not have the right number of elements or is non-monotonic, ScalarField issues a warning and restores sfYArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. If the input array is valid, ScalarField replaces the current value of sfYCStartV with the value of the first element of sfYArray, and the current value of sfYCEndV with the value of the last element. If sfYArray is set using a 2D array it must have the same dimension sizes as sfXArray. Each element specifies the location along the Y-Axis of a single data grid cell center or boundary. If sfYArray has the same dimension sizes as the data grid, the elements specify the grid cell centers for corresponding elements of the data grid. If both dimension sizes are one greater than the corresponding dimensions of the data grid, the elements specify the locations of the corners of the cell boundaries. Using NCL notation, for a data grid cell element (i,j): coordinate array element (i,j) locates the bottom-left corner, (i+1,j) locates the top-left corner, (i,j+1) locates the bottom-right corner, and (i+1,j+1) locates the top-right corner. For 2D coordinates, there is no requirement that the coordinates be monotonic. However, if the coordinates provided are not well-ordered as expected by the 2D-coordinate transformation routines, errors will occur when the Draw method is called. If the array does not contain valid dimension sizes, ScalarField issues a warning and restores sfYArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. You can specify sfYArray using a one or two dimensional array of any of the types allowed for sfDataArray. V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
sfYCActualEndF (MeshScalarField) This is a get-only resource that is set to the maximum value of sfYArray. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCActualEndF (ScalarField) When an ending location for a subset of the data is specified using sfYCEndSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. In this case, ScalarField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. The read-only resource sfYCActualEndF is set to the value of the actual ending location of the data subset along the Y Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, sfYCActualEndF has the same value as sfYCEndSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCActualStartF (MeshScalarField) This is a get-only resource that is set to the minimum value of sfYArray. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCActualStartF (ScalarField) When a starting location for a subset of the data is specified using sfYCStartSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. In this case, ScalarField selects a beginning index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. The read-only resource sfYCActualStartF is set to the value of the actual starting location of the data subset along the Y Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, sfYCActualStartF has the same value as sfYCStartSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCEndIndex (ScalarField) This resource specifies the larger of two indexes along the Y-Axis data dimension. Valid values range from one greater than the value of sfYCStartIndex to one less than the size of the dimension. It is one of four resources used to specify a rectangular subset of the data using array indexes. This is the only form of subsetting ScalarField supports when sfXArray and sfYArray are set using 2D coordinate arrays, Unless sfYArray is set with a 2D array, explicitly setting sfYCEndSubsetV overrides any value set for sfYCEndIndex and causes it to be set to the smallest array index value such that the requested data coordinate location is included within the subset. Otherwise, if you set sfYCEndIndex, sfYCEndSubsetV will be set based on its value. sfYCEndIndex retains its value when the data array changes, unless the Y-Axis dimension size also changes. In this case, assuming neither sfYCEndSubsetV nor sfYCEndIndex is explicitly set at the same time, sfYCEndIndex is set to the size of the Y-Axis dimension minus one. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCEndSubsetV (ScalarField) sfYCEndSubsetV specifies the ending location along the Y Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data array. It should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of sfYCStartV and sfYCEndV. If it is outside the coordinate extent, ScalarField issues a warning and sets it to the value of sfYCEndV. If the values of sfYCStartSubsetV and sfYCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by sfYCStartV and sfYCEndV, ScalarField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for sfYCEndSubsetV:     at initialization or when the Y-Axis dimension size changes, if sfYCEndIndex is not set, sfYCEndSubsetV takes the value of sfYCEndV;     else if sfYCEndIndex is set, or there is a change to sfYCStartV, sfYCEndV or sfYArray, sfYCEndSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of sfYCEndIndex;     else sfYCEndSubsetV retains its current value.  Since the data array grid consists of data located at discrete points, the location specified by sfYCEndSubsetV might well fall between two data points. In this case, ScalarField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. Get the value of the read-only resource sfYCActualEndF in order to find the exact end of the subset along the Y Axis. You may set sfYCEndSubsetV using any of the data types that ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If sfYArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfYCEndSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, sfYCEndSubsetV is set to the maximum value found within the specified subset of sfYArray. Otherwise sfYCEndSubsetV is set to the same value as sfYCEndV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCEndV (ScalarField) Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the Y Axis of the last element along the slower-varying dimension of the data. If the array resource sfYArray is set and found to be valid, ScalarField overwrites the current value of sfYCStartV, replacing it with the value of the last element of sfYArray. Otherwise, you can set sfYCStartV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If sfYCStartV is greater than sfYCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the Y Axis is opposite the direction of the positive Y Axis. If sfYArray is NULL or invalid and sfYCEndV is not specified, ScalarField sets sfYCEndV to the size of the slower-varying data dimension minus one. You may set sfYCEndV using any of the data types ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If you set sfXArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfXCEndV. If sfXArray is one-dimensional, sfXCEndV is set to the value of its last element. If sfXArray is two-dimensional, sfXCStartV is set to the maximum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCStartIndex (ScalarField) This resource specifies the smaller of two indexes along the Y-Axis dimension. Valid values range from 0 to one less than the value of sfYCEndIndex. It is one of four resources used to specify a rectangular subset of the data using array indexes. This is the only form of subsetting ScalarField supports when sfXArray and sfYArray are set using 2D coordinate arrays, Unless sfYArray is set with a 2D array, explicitly setting sfYCStartSubsetV overrides any value set for sfYCStartIndex and causes it to be set to the largest array index value such that the requested data coordinate location is included within the subset. Otherwise, if you set sfYCStartIndex, sfYCStartSubsetV will be set based on its value. sfYCStartIndex retains its value when the data array changes, unless the Y-Axis dimension size also changes. In this case, assuming neither sfYCStartSubsetV nor sfYCStartIndex is explicitly set at the same time, sfYCStartIndex is set to 0. Default: 0 
sfYCStartSubsetV (ScalarField) sfYCStartSubsetV specifies the starting location along the Y Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data array. It should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of sfYCStartV and sfYCEndV. If it is outside the coordinate extent, ScalarField issues a warning and sets it to the value of sfYCStartV. If the values of sfYCStartSubsetV and sfYCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by sfYCStartV and sfYCEndV, ScalarField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for sfYCStartSubsetV:     at initialization or when the Y-Axis dimension size changes, if sfYCStartIndex is also set, sfYCStartSubsetV takes the value of sfYCStartV;     else if sfYCStartIndex is set, or there is a change to sfYCStartV, sfYCEndV or sfYArray, sfYCStartSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of sfYCStartIndex;     else sfYCStartSubsetV retains its current value.  Since the data array grid consists of data located at discrete points, the location specified by sfYCStartSubsetV might well fall between two data points. In this case, ScalarField selects a beginning index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. Get the value of the read-only resource sfYCActualStartF in order to find the exact start of the subset along the Y Axis. You may set sfYCStartSubsetV using any of the data types that ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If sfYArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfYCStartSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, sfYCStartSubsetV is set to the mimimum value found within the specified subset of sfYArray. Otherwise sfYCStartSubsetV is set to the same value as sfYCStartV. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCStartV (ScalarField) Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the Y Axis of the first element of the slow-varying dimension of the data. If the array resource sfYArray is NULL, you can set sfYCStartV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If sfYCStartV is greater than sfYCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the Y Axis is opposite the direction of the positive Y Axis. If sfYArray is NULL and sfYCStartV is not specified, ScalarField sets sfYCStartV to the value 0. You may set sfYCStartV using any of the data types ScalarField accepts for the sfDataArray resource. If you set sfYArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, ScalarField ignores any value set for sfYCStartV. If sfYArray is one-dimensional, sfYCStartV is set to the value of its first element. If sfYArray is two-dimensional, sfYCStartV is set to the minimum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
sfYCStride (ScalarField) When sfYCStride has a value greater than one, the ScalarField object creates a new array containing only rows indexed along the Y dimension by successive multiples (starting with 0) of the sfYCStride value added to the starting index. The starting index is based on the current state of the applicable subsetting resources; it is 0 if no array subsetting is in effect. The resulting array is passed to the receiving plot object. Note that if ending index minus starting index is not an exact multiple of the sfYCStride value, then the data coordinate range may be reduced slightly. The sfYCStride resource is currently ignored if sfXArray and sfYArray contain 2D coordinate arrays. Default: 1 
sfYCellBounds (MeshScalarField) Set this resource and sfXCellBounds with two dimensional arrays to specify the boundaries of the cells surrounding each data node. The first dimension must have the same number of elements as sfDataArray. The second dimension should be large enough to contain all the vertices of the polygons that define the cell boundaries. This resource specifies the locations along the Y Axis of the vertices of the bounding cells. If all the cells do not have the same number of vertices, the value of the last valid vertex should be repeated for the extra elements of cells with fewer vertices. Given the resources sfXCellBounds and sfYCellBounds, the triangles defining the mesh will be deduced by sorting and matching the vertices from adjoining cell boundaries. Default: NULL 
stArrowLengthF This resource specifies, in units of NDC, the length of the lines used to draw the directional arrows that appear periodically along the length of the streamlines. At initialization or any time stArrowLengthF is given a value less than or equal to 0.0, StreamlinePlot calculates a value for stArrowLengthF based on the NDC size of an individual grid cell assuming a linear transformation from data to NDC space. Otherwise, when stArrowLengthF is not set explicitly, StreamlinePlot makes proportional adjustments to its value in response to changes in the assumed NDC size of the grid cell (resulting from changes to the viewport size and/or the number of elements in the data grid). Default: <dynamic> Default: 0.0 
stArrowStride StreamlinePlot draws directional arrows based on the data grid location. No more than one directional arrow can be drawn within each grid box. This resource allows you to draw fewer directional arrows by skipping grid boxes. If stArrowStride is set to 3, for instance, only every third grid box (along each axis direction) will be eligible for a directional arrow. Of course, the arrow will appear only if a streamline is actually drawn within the area of the grid box. Default: 2 
stCrossoverCheckCount This resource specifies the number of iterations through the streamline-building loop between checks for streamline crossover, that is, one streamline growing closer than stMinLineSpacingF to previously created streamlines. A negative value causes Streamlines to check for crossover only when a new data grid box is entered. At each crossover check, the current streamline position is compared with a sampling of previous streamline positions retained in an internal circular list. This list is currently fixed to a length of 750. Since up to this number of comparisons are performed at each crossover check, the frequency with which these checks are performed can have a noticeable impact on the drawing time. Default: -1 
stExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn This boolean resource allows you control the labels that appear in the StreamlinePlot LabelBar explicitly. When set True, StreamlinePlot does not block the LabelBar resources lbLabelStrings and lbLabelAlignment. Therefore you can directly control both the contents of the LabelBar's label strings and their alignment with respect to the label boxes. When stExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn is set False, StreamlinePlot sets both of these resources based on the values of the stLevels array resource and the value of the resource stLabelBarEndLabelsOn. If you set this resource True but do not set the lbLabelStrings array resource, StreamlinePlot will set it for you one time. This allows you to get an initial set of strings as a starting point for any customization you want to perform. Default: False 
stLabelBarEndLabelsOn When this boolean resource is set True and stExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn is False, StreamlinePlot creates labels for the two ends of the LabelBar. The label at one end will be a string representation of a minimum value and at the other end will be a string representation of the maximum value. These values represent either a vector magnitude or, if stUseScalarArray is set True, some other scalar value. Both strings will be formatted according to the format specification in effect for the other labels provided by StreamlinePlot to the LabelBar. Default: False 
stLabelFormat The stLabelFormat resource is a string that specifies a printing format for StreamlinePlot labels according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. Currently, this resource controls the formatting of numerical values supplied to the StreamlinePlot object's optional LabelBar. 
stLengthCheckCount This resource specifies the number of iterations through the streamline-building loop between each check of the streamline growth. If the distance between the current position of the streamline and the position saved at the time of the previous check is less than a minimum amount, defined as stMinStepFactorF times stStepSizeF, then the current streamline is terminated and a new one begun if possible. Default: 35 
stLevelColors The elements of this array of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray can be set using an array of color indexes, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If stMonoLineColor is False, this resource controls the progressive step-wise coloring of the streamlines based on the interpolated magnitude or other scalar value at each step location. Each element of stLevelColors specifies the color for locations along the streamline whose associated scalar data value is less than the corresponding element of the stLevels array. Note that there is always one more color than there are levels. The first element of stLevelColors specifies a color index for any location associated data value less than the value of stMinLevelValF. The highest currently used element of stLevelColors specifies a color for locations with associated data values greater than the value of stMaxLevelValF. Although backwards compatibility is for the most part maintained, beginning with version 6.1.0, this resource supports the new 32-bit color model, as follows: If stLevelColors is not set explicitly, its values are derived from the settings of stLevelPalette and stSpanLevelPalette, or, if stLevelPalette is not set, wkColorMap and stSpanLevelPalette. If stSpanLevelPalette is True, the values are distributed evenly through the range of colors available from stLevelPalette or wkColorMap. Otherwise, the values are sequential. If the colors are derived from stLevelPalette the first color comes from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color comes from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. If some but not all of the available elements of stLevelColors are explicitly set, the remaining elements will be determined as if stSpanLevelPalette has the value False. For backwards compatibility, colors set based on wkColorMap remain indexed to the current color map associated with the workstation. Consequently, if the workstation color map is changed prior to drawing the plot, the color indexes will map into the new color map. In contrast, color indexes derived from the stLevelPalette resource always refer to a specific color regardless of changes to wkColorMap. Default: <dynamic> 
stLevelCount A read-only resource set to the actual number of levels chosen during the level selection process. Default: 16 
stLevelPalette This resource of type NhlTColorDefinitionGenArray allows you to set a color palette from which the values assigned to stLevelColors are chosen. You can set this resource to the string name of a predefined color map, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If you set stLevelPalette using a predefined color map, it will have two fewer elements than if you set wkColorMap using the same color map. This is because the wkColorMap resource contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Use stSpanLevelPalette to indicate whether to span the full color palette or to simply use sequentially increasing values. Default: None 
stLevelSelectionMode This enumerated resource of type NhlTLevelSelectionMode provides four methods for selecting the levels used to color the streamlines: AutomaticLevels     Ordinarily this mode determines levels by picking a spacing value from a set of relatively "round" numbers scaled by powers of 10 to the range of the data. This set of numbers is as follows: 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0. The number of levels chosen will be as close as possible to the value of stMaxLevelCount without exceeding it. Once the spacing is chosen, the minimum level is set to the value of the least multiple of the spacing greater than the minimum data value. Likewise the maximum vector level becomes the greatest multiple of the spacing less than the maximum data value. Based on these values, StreamlinePlot sets the resources stLevelSpacingF, stMinLevelValF, and stMaxLevelValF appropriately.     On the other hand, if you explicitly set the resource stLevelSpacingF to a valid value greater than 0.0 and less than the range of the data, it will be used as the interval spacing. The minimum and maximum levels are calculated as before. If as a consequence, stMaxLevelCount is less than the number of levels so specified, it will be set to the number of levels actually needed. However, if the choice of spacing causes the absolute maximum number of levels (currently 255) to be exceeded, StreamlinePlot will issue a warning message and recalculate the spacing as previously described.     In any case, StreamlinePlot sets the elements of the array resource stLevels to the values of the levels chosen and the read-only resource stLevelCount to the number of levels.  ManualLevels     ManualLevels mode bases the choice of levels on the values of the resources stLevelSpacingF, stMinLevelValF, and stMaxLevelValF. Starting at stMinLevelValF, vector levels are created at intervals spaced by the value of stLevelSpacingF until stMaxLevelValF is reached. The final vector level will always be stMaxLevelValF. StreamlinePlot sets elements of the array resource stLevels to the values of each vector level chosen and the read-only resource stLevelCount to the number of levels. If the current value of stMaxLevelCount is less than stLevelCount, it is reset to the value of stLevelCount. However, if the level count would exceed the absolute maximum number of levels, currently 255, StreamlinePlot issues a warning and chooses a new value of stLevelSpacingF based on the value of stMaxLevelCount.     If you choose ManualLevels selection mode when the StreamlinePlot object is created, and do not set stMinLevelValF, StreamlinePlot will choose levels as if you had set AutomaticLevels mode. If you set stMinLevelValF only, a default spacing is used, and the value of stMaxLevelValF is determined as it would be for AutomaticLevels mode.  ExplicitLevels     This mode allows you to specify the value of each level by explicitly setting the contents of the stLevels array. If you choose ExplicitLevels selection mode when creating a StreamlinePlot object, but do not specify the contents of the stLevels array, StreamlinePlot will choose levels as if you had specified AutomaticLevels mode. Thereafter, when you set ExplicitLevels mode, StreamlinePlot uses the current contents of stLevels, whether or not you set it explicitly.     If the number of elements in stLevels exceeds the absolute maximum number of levels (currently 255), StreamlinePlot issues a warning and the mode defaults to AutomaticLevels. Note that StreamlinePlot always sorts the elements of stLevels into a monotonically increasing sequence. After sorting, stMinLevelValF is set equal to the value of first element of stLevels, and stMaxLevelValF is set to the value of the last element. stLevelSpacingF is set to the average value of the spacing separating each level.  EqualSpacedLevels     For this mode, StreamlinePlot divides the range spanning the dataset minimum and maximum values into stMaxLevelCount+1 equally spaced intervals. stLevelSpacingF is set to the value of this interval. stMinLevelValF is set to the value of the dataset minimum plus the value of stLevelSpacingF. stMaxLevelValF is set to the value of the dataset maximum minus the value of stLevelSpacingF. This results in stMaxLevelCount levels; therefore StreamlinePlot sets the read-only resource stLevelCount equal to stMaxLevelCount.  Default: AutomaticLevels 
stLevelSpacingF When the stLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels or when the stLevelSelectionMode is AutomaticLevels, and stLevelSpacingF is explicitly set, stLevelSpacingF determines the spacing between vector intervals. Otherwise, the StreamlinePlot object sets the value of stLevelSpacingF based on the levels actually chosen. When the stLevelSelectionMode is ExplicitLevels, stLevelSpacingF will be set to the arithmetic average of the spacing between levels. Default: 5.0 
stLevels An array of floats containing values that determine the color of incremental steps along each streamline when stMonoLineColor is set False. If stScalarFieldData is valid and the resource stUseScalarArray is set True, the level values are based on the scalar array data; otherwise the level values are based on the magnitudes of the vector elements in the vector field. If the stLevelSelectionMode is ExplicitLevels, you may set these values yourself. Otherwise, the StreamlinePlot object sets the elements of this array. Default: <dynamic> 
stLineColor This resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets the color index used to draw the streamlines. Default: Foreground 
stLineOpacityF Sets the opacity of streamlines in a plot. Specify a floating-point value in the range from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
stLineStartStride StreamlinePlot can start only one streamline within each data grid box. This resource allows you to define a sparser streamline plot by allowing only certain grid boxes to be eligible for starting a streamline. If stLineStartStride is set to 3, for instance, only every third grid box (along each axis direction) will be eligible for starting a streamline. A streamline will actually be started within an eligible grid box only if no previously drawn streamline passes through the grid box. This resource is ignored if the resource stMinDistanceF is set to a positive non-zero value. Default: 2 
stLineThicknessF This resource sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the streamlines and also the directional arrows. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
stMapDirection This resource controls whether the streamline direction is mapped into the same coordinate space as the location of the vector data grid point, or whether it is rendered in a locally uniform Cartesian coordinate space. This resource has an effect whenever a non-uniform transformation is in effect. These include most of the MapTransformation transformations and IrregularTransformation transformations. Also included are logarithmic transformations provided by the LogLinTransformation and even linear transformations when the X and Y unit size is different. Default: True 
stMaxLevelCount When the stLevelSelectionMode is AutomaticLevels and stLevelSpacingF is not explicitly set, StreamlinePlot picks a number of levels less than or equal to the current value of stMaxLevelCount. If the stLevelSelectionMode is EqualSpacedLevels, StreamlinePlot picks exactly stMaxLevelCount levels. If stMaxLevelCount exceeds the absolute maximum level count allowed by StreamlinePlot (currently 255), a warning is issued and the value is reset to this maximum. If stLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels or ExplicitLevels or AutomaticLevels with stLevelSpacingF explicitly set, StreamlinePlot sets stMaxLevelCount to the number of levels actually used if this number is greater than the current value of stMaxLevelCount. Default: 16 
stMaxLevelValF When the stLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels, the value of stMaxLevelValF, if set, determines the highest level. Otherwise, StreamlinePlot sets the stMaxLevelValF to a value equal to the highest level chosen by the level setting algorithm. Default: <dynamic> 
stMinArrowSpacingF This resource specifies an NDC minimum distance for adjacent directional arrowheads along a single streamline. If the data grid is transformed in such a way that adjacent grid cells become very close in NDC space, as for instance in many map projections near the poles, you can use this resource to help reduce the otherwise cluttered appearance of these regions of the plot. If stMinArrowSpacingF is less than or equal to 0.0, then no arrowheads are eliminated. When stMinArrowSpacingF is not set explcitly, StreamlinePlot adjusts its value in proportion to changes to vpWidthF. 
stMinDistanceF This resource specifies a minimum distance in NDC space that is to separate the grid boxes eligible for starting streamlines. Potential starting grid boxes are eliminated until no grid boxes remain that are closer than the specified value in NDC space to any neighboring grid box. This resource should be considered an alternative to stLineStartStride especially applicable to situations involving non-linear transformations from grid space to NDC space. If stMinDistanceF has a positive non-zero value the stLineStartStride resource is ignored. When this resource has its default value, 0.0, no starting grid boxes are eliminated. Default: 0.0 
stMinLevelValF When the stLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels, the value of stMinLevelValF, if set, determines the lowest level value. Otherwise, StreamlinePlot sets the stMinLevelValF to a value equal to the lowest level chosen by the level setting algorithm. Default: <dynamic> 
stMinLineSpacingF This resource specifies the minimum distance in NDC that a streamline in progress is allowed to approach existing streamlines before being terminated. In general, giving this value a larger number increases the distance between streamlines, and has a tendency to create more, but shorter streamlines. The spacing is only checked at intervals, so streamlines can sometimes approach closer than the specified distance. The stCrossoverCheckCount resource determines the frequency with with the check is performed. At initialization or any time stMinLineSpacingF is given a value less than or equal to 0.0, StreamlinePlot calculates a value for stMinLineSpacingF based on the NDC size of an individual grid cell assuming a linear transformation from data to NDC space. Otherwise, when stMinLineSpacingF is not set explicitly, StreamlinePlot makes proportional adjustments to its value in response to changes in the assumed NDC size of the grid cell (resulting from changes to the viewport size and/or the number of elements in the data grid). Default: <dynamic> 
stMinStepFactorF This resource specifies a multiplying factor for the stStepSizeF resource that determines the minimum amount the streamline must have grown each time the stream progress is checked in order not to be terminated. The stream progress is checked each stLengthCheckCount iterations through the stream-building loop. Points of convergence or divergence typically cause stream growth to diminish and the streamline eventually to be terminated. Default: 2.0 
stMonoLineColor When this resource is set True, streamlines are colored using a single HLU color index, as specified by the value of the scalar resource stLineColor. When False, the elements of the array resource stLevelColors are used to set the colors of each step along the streamline based on the interpolated value of the magnitude or associated scalar quantity. Default: True 
stNoDataLabelOn This boolean resource, when set True, causes a label to appear when StreamlinePlot is drawn without any data having been provided. Except for the label string, all attributes of this label, including its position, are set using resources belonging to the zero field label. When set False, no such label appears. Default: True 
stNoDataLabelString This resource contains the string that appears in the 'No Data' label if you draw a StreamlinePlot object without providing any data. No substitution substrings are allowed in this label, since all the substitutions depend on data being available. Except for the boolean switch that turns it on and off, all attributes of this label, including its position, are set using resources belonging to the zero field label. Default: "NO STREAMLINE DATA" 
stScalarFieldData Specifies the id of a ScalarField data object. If this resource is set with a valid ScalarField object and the resource stUseScalarArray is set True, StreamlinePlot will use the scalar array data for coloring the streamlines. In order for StreamlinePlot to consider the ScalarField object valid, it must find that it has the same number of elements along each dimension as are found in the VectorField object. Note that currently the number of elements is checked only after strides and subsetting are applied. The data coordinate extents set for the ScalarField object are ignored. For now, the data coordinate extents of the processed ScalarField data are assumed to coincide with the data coordinate extents of the VectorField data. Default: none 
stScalarMissingValColor When stUseScalarArray is True, this resource sets the HLU index of the fill or line color used to draw portions of a streamline where an interpolated scalar value cannot be determined because of missing data in the scalar field. Default: Foreground 
stSpanLevelPalette If set to True, and if stLevelColors is not set using explicit values, then StreamlinePlot automatically spans the stLevelPalette resource to determine color index values for stLevelColors. If stLevelPalette is not set then the wkColorMap resource is spanned instead. If set to False, then StreamlinePlot uses consecutively ascending values to populate stLevelColors. If the colors are derived from stLevelPalette the first color will be determined from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color will come from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Default: True 
stStepSizeF This resource specifies, in NDC, the basic step size used to build the streamlines. Where the flow direction changes rapidly, the step size is scaled down from the basic step size in order to retain accuracy. Smaller step sizes produce a more accurate plot at the cost of a longer drawing time. At initialization or any time stStepSizeF is given a value less than or equal to 0.0, StreamlinePlot calculates a value for stStepSizeF based on the NDC size of an individual grid cell assuming a linear transformation from data to NDC space. Otherwise, when stStepSizeF is not set explicitly, StreamlinePlot makes proportional adjustments to its value in response to changes in the assumed NDC size of the grid cell (resulting from changes to the viewport size and/or the number of elements in the data grid). Default: <dynamic> 
stStreamlineDrawOrder This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when the streamlines are drawn relative to the drawing of other elements of a composite plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw the streamlines before the standard draw phase; the arrows will be overlaid by any subsequently drawn elements.  Draw     Draw the streamlines during the standard draw phase; the arrows will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw phase, but will underlie elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw the streamlines after the standard draw; the arrows will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw and draw phases.  Default: Draw 
stUseScalarArray If this boolean resource is set True, the resource stScalarFieldData is set with a valid ScalarField object, and the appropriate StreamlinePlot resources are set to enable multi-colored streamlines, then the ScalarField data are used to select the level (and hence the color index) assigned to each glyph. Otherwise, when multi-colored streamlines are enabled, coloring will be based on the interpolated vector magnitude at each step location along the streamline. Default: False 
stVectorFieldData Specifies the id of a VectorField data object. There is no default for this resource; it is the only resource that must be set in order for the StreamlinePlot object to draw a plot. You may create a StreamlinePlot object without setting the stVectorFieldData resource, and auxiliary annotations such as tick marks and titles may appear as the result of a draw, but the StreamlinePlot itself will not show up. The VectorField object can provide either regularly spaced or irregular rectangular gridded data to the StreamlinePlot object, and the VectorField object provides a number of resources for controlling the ingestion of the raw data. Default: <none> 
stZeroFLabelAngleF This resource specifies the angle, in degrees, of the zero field label text and its surrounding box. Default: 0.0 
stZeroFLabelBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding the zero field label. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set stZeroFLabelBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). Default: Background 
stZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when stZeroFLabelFontQuality is set to High, the StreamlinePlot object writes zero field label text with proportional spacing. Setting the stZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of stZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF. When stZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when stZeroFLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
stZeroFLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the zero field label. Default: 0 
stZeroFLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the zero field label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in characters that appear thinner. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters appear wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
stZeroFLabelFontColor This resource specifies the HLU color index used to render zero field label text. Default: True 
stZeroFLabelFontHeightF This resource controls the height in NDC of characters used in the text of the zero field label. The character width scales proportionally, unless you also modify the aspect ratio using the stZeroFLabelFontAspectF resource. The zero label text height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set stZeroFLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> 
stZeroFLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the StreamlinePlot zero field label. Default: High 
stZeroFLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw zero field label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the stZeroFLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
stZeroFLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the zero field label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
stZeroFLabelJust This resource of type NhlTJustification, after constraint to an appropriate value based on stZeroFLabelSide, sets the justification of the zero field label annotation with respect to its base location. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Default: CenterCenter 
stZeroFLabelOn The StreamlinePlot object draws a zero field label annotation only when stZeroFLabelOn is set True and the ScalarField data are determined to consist entirely of zero magnitude vectors within the limits of the available precision. Default: True 
stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the zero field label annotation orthogonal to the current stZeroFLabelSide and directed away from the center of the viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
stZeroFLabelParallelPosF stZeroFLabelParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the zero field label annotation parallel to the current stZeroFLabelSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
stZeroFLabelPerimColor This resource sets the HLU color index used to draw the perimeter of the zero field label box. Default: Foreground 
stZeroFLabelPerimOn stZeroFLabelPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether StreamlinePlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding the zero field label. If set False, no outline will be drawn. Default: True 
stZeroFLabelPerimSpaceF stZeroFLabelPerimSpaceF determines the spacing or margin between the text of the zero field label and the edge of the zero field label box as a fraction of the current label text height. Default: 0.33 
stZeroFLabelPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the zero field label box. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
stZeroFLabelSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the zero field annotation in relation to the sides of the plot object. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources, stZeroFLabelParallelPosF and stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of the stZeroFLabelJust appropriately. There are four settings, which behave as follows, unless stZeroFLabelZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. stZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. stZeroFLabelJust is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.  Bottom     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the bottom viewport boundary. stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. stZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. stZeroFLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, TopCenter, or TopLeft.  Right     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the right viewport boundary. stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. stZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. stZeroFLabelJust is constrained to TopLeft, CenterLeft, or BottomLeft.  Left     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the left viewport boundary. stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. stZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. stZeroFLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, CenterRight, or BottomRight.  If stZeroFLabelZone is set to 0, The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to the viewport center. If stZeroFLabelZone is 1, the direction of the stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the stZeroFLabelZone is either 0 or 1, stZeroFLabelJust is not constrained, and stZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
stZeroFLabelString Specifies the string to use when drawing a zero field label. The string may contain function codes. Default: "ZERO FIELD" 
stZeroFLabelTextDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text in the zero field label. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These descriptions apply before rotation due to stZeroFLabelAngleF. Default: Across 
stZeroFLabelZone StreamlinePlot implements the zero field label as an embedded annotation. stZeroFLabelZone specifies the PlotManager zone assigned to the zero field annotation. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. If stZeroFLabelZone is set to 0, the positional origin is the center of the plot viewport; otherwise it is on or outside one of the sides of the viewport. If you create a StreamlinePlot object without an active PlotManager by setting tfPlotManagerOn False, then StreamlinePlot manages the zero field annotation by itself. In this case, the stZeroFLabelZone resource is not as meaningful. Default: 0 
tfDoNDCOverlay Ordinarily, the data space of a transform added as an overlay is transformed into the data space of the base plot. If tfDoNDCOverlay is set True, however, this transformation does not take place. Instead, the transform is aligned in NDC space with the base plot. Its viewport is sized and positioned to coincide with the base plot's viewport. As with normal overlays, the base plot still assumes responsibility for drawing the transform and managing its annotations. Originally, tfDoNDCOverlay was of type NhlTBoolean. However, this did not provide enough flexiblity to handle an overlay on a mapplot when mpShapeMode is set to FixedAspectNoFitBB. In this case the overlay needs to extend only over the data extent, but the data extent does not in general occupy the full extent of the viewport. Therefore, the type of tfDoNDCOverlay has been changed to NhlTOverlayMode, allowing three options, as follows: DataTransform     Transform overlay into the data space of the base plot. Settting the resource to False is equivalent to specifying this option.  NDCViewport     Render the overlay so as to occupy the full viewport of the base plot, without transformation into the base plot's data space. Settting the resource to True is equivalent to specifying this option.  NDCDataExtent     Render the overlay so as to occupy only the extent of the viewport occupied by the data extent of the base plot, but without transformation into the base plot's data space.  Default: False 
tfPlotManagerOn This boolean resource specifies whether a transform should instantiate a PlotManager composite class member. It is a create-only resource; if a plotmanager is not instantiated when the transform is created, it cannot be instantiated later. If a plotmanager is activated, the transform becomes a plot object, allowing it to act as a base plot for annotations and overlays. Otherwise, it is called a simple transform. The primary reason to create a simple transform would be to conserve memory and improve performance. Default: True 
tfPolyDrawList This array resource specifies a list of Primitive objects that are to be drawn along with the transform's specialized plot elements when the Draw method is called. You add Primitive objects to tfPolyDrawList by calling the support function NhlAddPrimitive and remove them by by calling NhlRemovePrimitive. Alternatively, you may create (or recreate) the list as a whole using the SetValues method. Each list element must be the id of an existing Primitive object. When the transform's Draw method is executed the Primitive objects are rendered in the order of their appearance in the tfPolyDrawList. The rendering may occur during any of the transform's draw phases, depending on the value of the tfPolyDrawOrder resource. The list ordering also determines which graphicstyle to apply when a primitive's prGraphicStyle resource is set to NullObjId (0). During the primitive drawing sequence a notion of the "current" graphicstyle is maintained. Initially, the Workstation default graphicstyle, as specified by wkDefGraphicStyleId, is current. Subsequently, whenever a primitive that explicitly specifies a graphicstyle is encountered in the tfPolyDrawList, its graphicstyle becomes current. Any primitive whose prGraphicStyle resource evaluates to NullObjId is rendered using the current graphicstyle. Default: NULL 
tfPolyDrawOrder Default: PostDraw This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when the Primitive objects specified in the tfPolyDrawList will be drawn relative to other elements of the transform. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw Primitive objects listed in the tfPolyDrawList prior to the standard draw phase, before any PreDraw phase plot elements belonging to the transform.  Draw     Draw Primitive objects listed in the tfPolyDrawList during the standard draw phase, before any Draw phase plot elements belonging to the transform.  PostDraw     Draw Primitive objects listed in the tfPolyDrawList after the standard draw phase, before any PostDraw phase plot elements belonging to the transform. 
tiDeltaF Sets the default offset for all of the titles. The absolute value of this resource multiplied by the appropriate ti...FontHeightF resource value gives the amount, in NDC, that the titles will be offset perpendicularly from the viewport boundary in the direction opposite the viewport center. After the effect of this offset is calculated, if any part of a title is left overlapping the viewport, it is adjusted farther outward such that no overlap remains. If tiMainOffsetYF, tiXAxisOffsetYF, or tiYAxisOffsetXF are non-zero, they specify an additional offset applied unconditionally from the adjusted position in the same or the opposite direction. Default: 1.5 
tiMainAngleF Angle of counterclockwise rotation of the Main title. Default: 0.00 
tiMainConstantSpacingF If this resource has the value 0.0, the characters in the Main title will be proportionally spaced. If it has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of tiMainConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If tiMainConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') placed next to each other. As tiMainConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
tiMainDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text used for the Main title. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These descriptions apply before any rotation due to tiMainAngleF is applied to the Main title. Default: Across 
tiMainFont This resource of type NhlTFont sets the font index for the Main title. Default: 0 
tiMainFontAspectF This resource sets the aspect ratio, defined as the height divided by the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. Its value determines the width of characters in the Main title relative to tiMainFontHeightF. If given the value 1.0, wide characters (such as 'M'or 'W') will be approximately square in shape. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters, while values decreasing from 1.0 result in wider characters. Default: 1.3125 
tiMainFontColor Sets the font color index for the Main title. Default: 1 
tiMainFontHeightF Sets the font height in NDC coordinates of the Main title. This value scales proportionally to changes in the width of the viewport. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.025 
tiMainFontQuality Sets the font quality for the Main title. Default: High 
tiMainFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the Main title. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the tiMainFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
tiMainFuncCode Specifies the character used to delimit Text Function Codes that may be embedded in the Main title. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
tiMainJust This resource of type NhlTJustification sets the Justification point of the Main title. Default: CenterCenter 
tiMainOffsetXF Sets an offset in NDC coordinates by which the Main title will be displaced in a direction parallel to the X Axis from its base location. This value does not scale in response to changes in the viewport size. Default: 0.0 
tiMainOffsetYF Sets a positive or negative offset in NDC coordinates by which the Main title will be displaced in a direction parallel to the Y Axis from its base location. This offset is applied after any offset due to tiDeltaF and the adjustment performed to prevent the Main title from intruding into the viewport (or into the X-Axis title). Therefore, this resource allows you to displace the title any distance away from the viewport or into its interior. The positive direction coincides with that of the NDC Y Axis. Its value does not scale in response to changes in the viewport size. Default: 0.0 
tiMainOn Setting this boolean resource True causes the Main title to appear. Setting it False turns the Main title off. By default, tiMainOn will be set True if and only if you explicitly set tiMainString. Default: <dynamic> 
tiMainPosition This resource of type NhlTPosition specifies the base horizontal location of the justification point of the Main title with respect to the viewport boundaries. There are three choices: Left     Locate the base position of the justification point of the Main title along the line of the left edge of the viewport.  Center     Locate the base position of the justification point of the Main title along the line of the horizontal center of the viewport.  Right     Locate the base position of justification point of the Main title along the line of the right edge of the viewport.  From any of these base positions, you can displace the Main title left or right by setting the resource tiMainOffsetXF. If you set tiMainPosition to Bottom or Top Title issues a warning message and reverts to the default value, Center. Default: Center 
tiMainSide This resource of type NhlTPosition specifies the side of the viewport relative to which the justification point of the Main title is located. There are two choices: Top     Locate the justification point of the Main title relative to the top edge of the viewport.  Bottom     Locate the justification point of the Main title relative to the bottom edge of the viewport.  If you set tiMainPosition to Left, Center, or Right Title issues a warning message and reverts to its default value. Default: Top 
tiMainString Sets the string to use as the Main title. The string may contain Text Function Codes that allow you to control typographical attributes such as subscripting and superscripting, change fonts within a string, embed newlines, etc. Default: "Main" 
tiUseMainAttributes When this boolean resource is set True, the Title object copies the value of Main title resources that set most of the text attributes to the corresponding X-Axis and Y-Axis title resources. The resources copied include tiMainFont, tiMainFontHeightF, tiMainFontAspectF, tiMainConstantSpacingF, tiMainFontThicknessF, tiMainFuncCode, tiMainFontColor, tiMainFont, tiMainJust, and tiMainFontQuality. Default: False 
tiXAxisAngleF Sets the counterclockwise rotation angle for the X-Axis title. Default: 0.0 
tiXAxisConstantSpacingF If this resource has the value 0.0, the characters in the X-Axis title will be proportionally spaced. If it has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of tiXAxisConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If tiXAxisConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') placed next to each other. As tiXAxisConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
tiXAxisDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text used for the X-Axis title. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These descriptions apply before any rotation due to tiXAxisAngleF is applied to the X-Axis title. Default: Across 
tiXAxisFont This resource of type NhlTFont sets the font index for the X-Axis title. Default: 0 
tiXAxisFontAspectF This resource sets the aspect ratio, defined as the height divided by the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. Its value determines the width of characters in the X-Axis title relative to tiXAxisFontHeightF. If given the value 1.0, wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') will be approximately square in shape. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters, while values decreasing from 1.0 result in wider characters. Default: 1.3125 
tiXAxisFontColor Sets the font color for the X-Axis title. Default: 1 
tiXAxisFontHeightF Sets the font height in NDC coordinates of the X-Axis title. This value scales proportionally to changes in the width of the viewport. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.025 
tiXAxisFontQuality Sets the font quality for the X-Axis title. Default: High 
tiXAxisFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the X-Axis title. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the tiXAxisFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
tiXAxisFuncCode Specifies the character used to delimit Text Function Codes that may be embedded in the X-Axis title. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
tiXAxisJust This resource of type NhlTJustification sets the Justification point of the X-Axis title. Default: CenterCenter 
tiXAxisOffsetXF Sets an offset in NDC coordinates by which the X-Axis title will be displaced in a direction parallel to the X Axis from its base location. This value does not scale in response to changes in the viewport size. Default: 0.0 
tiXAxisOffsetYF Sets a positive or negative offset in NDC coordinates by which the X-Axis title will be displaced in a direction parallel to the Y Axis from its base location. This offset is applied after any offset due to tiDeltaF and the adjustment performed to prevent the X-Axis title from intruding into the viewport. Therefore, this resource allows you to displace the title any distance away from the viewport or into its interior. The positive direction coincides with that of the NDC Y Axis. Its value does not scale in response to changes in the viewport size. Default: 0.0 
tiXAxisOn Setting this boolean resource True causes the X-Axis title to appear. Setting it False turns the X-Axis title off. By default, tiXAxisOn will be set True if and only if you explicitly set tiXAxisString. Default: <dynamic> 
tiXAxisPosition This resource of type NhlTPosition specifies the base horizontal location of the justification point of the X-Axis title with respect to the viewport boundaries. There are three choices: Left     Locate the base position of the justification point of the X-Axis title along the line of the left edge of the viewport.  Center     Locate the base position of the justification point of the X-Axis title along the line of the horizontal center of the viewport.  Right     Locate the base position of the justification point of the X-Axis title along the line of the right edge of the viewport.  From any of these base positions, you can displace the X-Axis title left or right by setting the resource tiXAxisOffsetXF. If you set tiXAxisPosition to Bottom or Top, Title issues a warning message and reverts to the default value, Center. Default: Center 
tiXAxisSide This resource of type NhlTPosition specifies the side of the viewport relative to which the justification point of the X-Axis title is located. There are two choices: Top     Locate the justification point of the X-Axis title relative to the top edge of the viewport.  Bottom     Locate the justification point of the X-Axis title relative to the bottom edge of the viewport.  If you set tiXAxisPosition to Left, Center, or Right Title issues a warning message and reverts to the default value, Bottom. Default: Bottom 
tiXAxisString Sets the string to use as the X-Axis title. The string may contain Text Function Codes that allow you to control typographical attributes such as subscripting and superscripting, change fonts within a string, embed newlines, etc. Default: "XAxis" 
tiYAxisAngleF Sets the counterclockwise rotation angle for the Y-Axis title. Default: 90.0 
tiYAxisConstantSpacingF If this resource has the value 0.0, the characters in the Y-Axis title will be proportionally spaced. If it has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of tiYAxisConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If tiYAxisConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') placed next to each other. As tiYAxisConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
tiYAxisDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text used for the Y-Axis title. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These descriptions apply before any rotation due to tiYAxisAngleF is applied to the Y-Axis title. Default: Across 
tiYAxisFont This resource of type NhlTFont sets the font index for the Y-Axis title. Default: 0 
tiYAxisFontAspectF This resource sets the aspect ratio, defined as the height divided by the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. Its value determines the width of characters in the Y-Axis title relative to tiYAxisFontHeightF. If given the value 1.0, wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') will be approximately square in shape. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters, while values decreasing from 1.0 result in wider characters. Default: 1.3125 
tiYAxisFontColor Sets the font color for the Y-Axis title. Default: 1 
tiYAxisFontHeightF Sets the font height in NDC coordinates to use for the Y-Axis title. This values scales proportionally to changes in the height of the viewport. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.025 
tiYAxisFontQuality Sets the font quality for the Y-Axis title. Default: High 
tiYAxisFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the Y-Axis title. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the tiYAxisFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
tiYAxisFuncCode Specifies the character used to delimit Text Function Codes that may be embedded in the Y-Axis title. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
tiYAxisJust This resource of type NhlTJustification sets the Justification point of the Y-Axis title. Default: CenterCenter 
tiYAxisOffsetXF Sets a positive or negative offset in NDC coordinates by which the Y-Axis title will be displaced in a direction parallel to the X Axis from its base location. This offset is applied after any offset due to tiDeltaF and the adjustment performed to prevent the Y-Axis title from intruding into the viewport. Therefore, this resource allows you to displace the title any distance away from the viewport or into its interior. The positive direction coincides with that of the NDC X Axis. Its value does not scale in response to changes in the viewport size. Default: 0.0 
tiYAxisOffsetYF Sets an offset in NDC coordinates by which the Y-Axis title will be displaced in a direction parallel to the Y Axis from its base location. This value does not scale in response to changes in the viewport size. Default: 0.0 
tiYAxisOn Setting this boolean resource True causes the Y-Axis title to appear. Setting it False turns the Y-Axis title off. By default, tiYAxisOn will be set True if and only if you explicitly set tiYAxisString. Default: <dynamic> 
tiYAxisPosition This resource of type NhlTPosition specifies the base vertical location of the justification point of the Y-Axis title with respect to the viewport boundaries. There are three choices: Bottom     Locate the base position of the justification point of the Y-Axis title along the line of the bottom edge of the viewport.  Center     Locate the base position of the justification point of the Y-Axis title along the line of the horizontal center of the viewport.  Top     Locate the base position of the justification point of the Y-Axis title along the line of the top edge of the viewport.  From any of these base positions, you can displace the Y-Axis title up or down by setting the resource tiYAxisOffsetYF. If you set tiYAxisPosition to Right or Left Title issues a warning message and reverts to the default value, Center. Default: Center 
tiYAxisSide This resource of type NhlTPosition specifies the side of the viewport relative to which the justification point of the Y-Axis title is located. There are two choices: Left     Locate the justification point of the Y-Axis title relative to the left edge of the viewport.  Right     Locate the justification point of the Y-Axis title relative to the right edge of the viewport.  If you set tiYAxisPosition to Bottom, Center, or Top Title issues a warning message and reverts to the default value, Left. Default: Left 
tiYAxisString Sets the string to use as the Y-Axis title. The string may contain Text Function Codes that allow you to control typographical attributes such as subscripting and superscripting, change fonts within a string, embed newlines, etc. Default: "YAxis" 
tmBorderLineColor Set the color of the tick mark border. Default: 1 
tmBorderThicknessF Sets the linewidth scale factor for the tick mark border. The linewidth is a multiple of the parent workstation device's minimum linewidth. Default: 2.0 
tmEqualizeXYSizes When this boolean resource is set True, all four TickMark axes will share the same label font height and major and minor tick lengths. Setting any one of the label font height resources (tmXBLabelFontHeightF, tmXTLabelFontHeightF, tmYLLabelFontHeightF, or tmYRLabelFontHeightF) causes all the other label font height resources to assume the set value. Likewise, setting any one of the major tick length resources (tmXBMajorLengthF, tmXTMajorLengthF, tmYLMajorLengthF, or tmYRMajorLengthF) results in all major length resources assuming the set value. Setting any of the minor tick length resources (tmXBMinorLengthF, tmXTMinorLengthF, tmYLMinorLengthF, or tmYRMinorLengthF) has a similar effect for these resources. If more than one resource of the same type (e.g. label font heights) is is set for different axes at the same time, their values are averaged to determine the final set value. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: False 
tmLabelAutoStride When this boolean resource is set True, TickMark labels are checked for overlap before being drawn. If overlap would otherwise occur, a stride is set through the labels such that overlap will be avoided. The stride proceeds in both directions from a pivot label, chosen based on how "round" it is relative to the other labels. If the labels seem to be equally "round" or if the labels are non-numeric, then the shortest label is chosen as the pivot. The stride calculated as a result of setting tmLabelAutoStride is applied subsequent to any strides set by the tm..LabelStride resources and is independent of them. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: False 
tmSciNoteCutoff This resource sets the value used for all TickMark label formats that have the dynamic attribute set on for the exponent switch length (as specified by the Floating Point Format Specification scheme). By default all the label format strings set the exponent switch length dynamic attribute on, causing the value of tmSciNoteCutoff to specify the number of digits used to control switching between exponential and floating point format when generic formatting is in effect. If you explicitly set the exponent switch length conversion field (signaled by the '?' character) in the format string to anything other than the dynamic value ('*'), the value in the format string overrides the value set for tmSciNoteCutoff. Default: 6 
tmXBAutoPrecision When True, this boolean resource causes TickMark to set the precision (number of significant digits) for the bottom tick mark labels based on the range of values used for the labels. In general, the value of tmXBPrecision is ignored. However, if tmXBMode is set to Manual, the precision is set such that all significant digits necessary to express the value of the tmXBTickSpacingF resource are used in determining the precision. In this case, the value of tmXBPrecision sets a cap on the number of significant digits used to express the value of tmXBTickSpacingF. When set False, the value of tmXBPrecision controls the precision. However, if the significant digit conversion field (signaled by the '.' character) is set explicitly in the tmXBFormat string (according to the rules of the Floating Point Format Specification scheme), then the resources tmXBAutoPrecision and tmXBPrecision are both ignored, and the precision is controlled completely by the tmXBFormat specification. Default: True 
tmXBBorderOn Setting True turns bottom border on; False turns it off. Does not turn off bottom ticks. Default: True 
tmXBDataLeftF Sets the data value that maps to the left side of the bottom tick marks. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmXBDataRightF Sets the data value that maps to the right side of the bottom tick marks. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmXBFormat This string resource specifies, according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme, the format of the numbers used to label the major ticks along the bottom X Axis. It applies only when tmXBMode is set to Automatic or Manual. Unless set explicitly, the significant digits conversion field is set dynamically based on the values of the tmXBAutoPrecision and tmXBPrecision resources. Likewise, the exponent switch length conversion field is set dynamically based on the value of the tmSciNoteCutoff resource. If the leftmost significant digit conversion field has the dynamic attribute set, the assumed leftmost significant digit is set dynamically for each label based on the largest absolute value used to generate the bottom labels. Combined with the zero format flag, this has the effect of causing all the labels to contain the same number of places to the right of the decimal point. The default format string also sets the "at-sign" ('@') format flag to force fractional values to include an initial '0' character preceding the decimal point. In addition, the exponent conversion field includes, by default, the 's' flag to cause exponents to be written using the superscript notational form. If tmXBStyle is set to Log, exponential notation is forced on, regardless of the character used for the conversion specifier. Also the zero flag is turned off to ensure that the mantissas (which always evaluate to 1.0 because of the spacing enforced for Log style labels) are not turned on because of the need to fill out the significant digits on the right of the decimal point. Default: "0@*+^sg" 
tmXBIrrTensionF Specifies the value of the tension parameter applied to the spline approximation used to set up an irregular transformation based on the values in the tmXBIrregularPoints array. This resource is only used if tmXBStyle is Irregular. Small values (less than ~1.0) imply a relaxed approximation; large values (greater than ~5.0) imply a tight approximation. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 2.0 
tmXBIrregularPoints Used for Irregular style ticks only. Specifies an array of data locations spaced at equal intervals along the bottom X Axis. These points represent a discrete approximation to the desired coordinate system. These points must be strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing. Therefore, periodic coordinate systems can not be approximated using this resource. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
tmXBLabelAngleF Sets the counterclockwise rotation of the X-Axis bottom labels. Default: 0.0 
tmXBLabelConstantSpacingF If this resource has the value 0.0, the characters in the bottom X-Axis label will be proportionally spaced. If it has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of tmXBLabelConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If tmXBLabelConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') placed next to each other. As tmXBLabelConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
tmXBLabelDeltaF Sets an offset from the default location for the bottom tick mark labels. This value multiplied by the tmXBLabelFontHeightF represents the amount, in NDC coordinates, that the bottom tick marks will be displaced from their default location in the Y direction. A positive value moves labels in the positive direction in NDC coordinates, and a negative value moves labels in the negative direction. Default: 0.0 
tmXBLabelDirection Sets the drawing direction of the X-Axis bottom labels. Default: Across 
tmXBLabelFont Sets the font index for the bottom X-Axis labels. Default: 0 
tmXBLabelFontAspectF Sets the ratio of height/width for the bottom X-Axis labels. Default: 1.3125 
tmXBLabelFontColor Sets the color of the bottom X-Axis labels. Default: 1 
tmXBLabelFontHeightF Sets the font height in NDC coordinates for the bottom X Axis labels. This value scales proportionally to changes in the width of the viewport. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport width of 0.6 
tmXBLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the bottom X-Axis label. Default: High 
tmXBLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the bottom X-Axis label. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the tmXBLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
tmXBLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character for the X-Axis bottom labels. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
tmXBLabelJust Sets the justification point for all bottom X-Axis labels. Default: TopCenter 
tmXBLabelStride Used to skip tick mark labels. The value represents how many tick marks to skip between tick mark labels when drawing the tick mark labels. Will cause the tick mark object to draw first, then skip. Default: 0 
tmXBLabels When tmXBMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of strings that correspond to the values in tmXBValues. Each element of this resource is placed under the corresponding tick location in tmXBValues. If a string array element is set to NULL, no label will appear at the corresponding tick mark location. If you do not set tmXBLabels when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the bottom X Axis. When tmXBMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the strings that TickMark has chosen as labels for the bottom X Axis major ticks marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmXBLabelsOn Setting True turns on tick mark labels if tmXBOn is set; False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: True 
tmXBMajorLengthF Sets the length of the X-Axis bottom major tick marks in NDC coordinates. The length scales with changes to the viewport height, unless you explicitly set this resource at the same time as the height is changed. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport height of 0.6 
tmXBMajorLineColor Sets the line color index for the major tick marks. Default: 1 
tmXBMajorOutwardLengthF Length of the major X-Axis bottom tick marks that will be drawn on the outside of the tick mark border. Value is in NDC coordinates. This value scales proportionally to changes in height. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: 0.0 
tmXBMajorThicknessF Sets linewidth scale factor for bottom major tick marks. Value is a multiple of the minimum linewidth on the current device. Default: 2.0 
tmXBMaxLabelLenF This read-only resource returns the length in NDC of the longest string used as an individual label for the bottom X Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmXBMaxTicks Used for Automatic mode ticks only. Specifies the maximum allowable tick marks for the bottom X Axis. Default: 7 
tmXBMinLabelSpacingF This read-only resource returns the minimum distance in NDC from the start of one label string to the start of the next label string along the bottom X Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmXBMinorLengthF Sets the length in NDC coordinates for X bottom tick marks. This length scales with changes to the viewport height, unless you explicitly set tmXBMinorLengthF at the same time. Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.01 for a viewport height of 0.6 
tmXBMinorLineColor Sets color index for bottom minor tick marks. Default: 1 
tmXBMinorOn Setting this resource True turns on minor tick marks; False turns them off. Default: True 
tmXBMinorOutwardLengthF Length of minor X-Axis bottom tick marks that will be drawn on the outside of the tick mark border. Value is in NDC coordinates. This value scales proportionally to changes in height. Default: 0.0 
tmXBMinorPerMajor Sets the number of minor tick marks per major tick mark for the bottom X Axis. When using Log style tick marks, only the values 1, 4, and 8 are accepted as valid. If the Explicit mode is in effect, TickMark ignores this resource: you must instead specify the spacing of each minor tick individually using tmXBMinorValues. If you do not set this resource and the mode is Automatic, its value is determined dynamically depending on the major tick spacing, as follows: if the major spacing is 1 or 5 times some power of 10, tmXBMinorPerMajor is set to 4; if the spacing is 2 or 4 times a power of 10, it is set to 3; if the spacing is 3 times a power of 10, it is set to 2. Otherwise, if the mode is Manual, tmXBMinorPerMajor defaults to the value 3. Default: <dynamic> 
tmXBMinorThicknessF Sets linewidth scale factor for bottom minor tick marks. Value represents a multiple of the current device's minimum linewidth. Default: 1.0 
tmXBMinorValues When tmXBMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which the minor tick marks will be drawn. If not set, minor tick marks will be absent from the bottom X Axis. When tmXBMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the locations that TickMark has chosen for the bottom X Axis minor tick marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. Default: NULL 
tmXBMode This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkMode determines the method for specifying the spacing of the ticks and the contents of the labels along the bottom X Axis. It has three possible settings: Automatic:     Based on the values of tmXBDataLeftF and tmXBDataRightF, TickMark chooses a 'nice' spacing between the major tick marks, such that the number of major ticks does not exceed the value of tmXBMaxTicks. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmSciNoteCutoff, tmXBAutoPrecision, tmXBPrecision, and tmXBFormat.  Manual:     Starting with the value tmXBTickStartF, TickMark sets major tick marks at intervals separated by a distance of tmXBTickSpacingF until tmXBTickEndF is exceeded. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmXBDataLeftF and tmXBDataRightF may appear along the bottom X Axis. If tmXBTickStartF and tmXBTickEndF are not set, TickMark issues an informational message and sets tmXBTickStartF to the minimum of tmXBDataLeftF and tmXBDataRightF, and it sets tmXBTickEndF to the maximum of tmXBDataLeftF and tmXBDataRightF. If tmXBTickSpacingF is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmXBMode reverts to Automatic mode. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmXBTickSpacingF, tmSciNoteCutoff, tmXBAutoPrecision, tmXBPrecision, and tmXBFormat.  Explicit:     TickMark uses the array resource tmXBValues to determine the coordinate positions of the tick marks. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmXBDataLeftF and tmXBDataRightF may appear along the bottom X Axis. If tmXBValues is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmXBMode reverts to Automatic mode. The corresponding element of the string array resource tmXBLabels determines the label used for each tick specified by tmXBValues. If tmXBLabels is not set, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the bottom X Axis. You may optionally also set the array resource tmXBMinorValues to specify the locations of minor ticks along the axis.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: Automatic 
tmXBOn Setting True turns on bottom tick marks; False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: True 
tmXBPrecision If tmXBAutoPrecision is set False and the significant digit field in the tmXBFormat string (as specified by the Floating Point Format Specification scheme) has the dynamic attribute set on, this resource controls the precision used for the bottom tick mark labels. Assuming the default setting of the tmXBFormat resource, the value set for tmXBPrecision will be the number of digits used for the bottom tick mark label representing the value with the maximum absolute value. The other labels will have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point, but may have fewer digits to the left of the decimal point. All labels will be rounded to the number of decimal places represented. Default: 4 
tmXBStyle This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkStyle sets the style of the TickMark bottom X Axis. There are 5 styles: Linear:     A linear coordinate system is set up along the X Axis with the left boundary set to the value of tmXBDataLeftF and the right boundary set to the value of tmXBDataRightF. If tmXBDataLeftFand tmXBDataRightF are found to be equal when compared with a precision of 7 significant digits, a warning is issued and the bottom X-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Log:     A logarithmic coordinate system is set up along the X Axis with the left boundary set to the value of tmXBDataLeftF and the right boundary set to the value of tmXBDataRightF. If either tmXBDataLeftF or tmXBDataRightF is less than or equal to 0.0, a warning is issued and the bottom X-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Irregular:     An irregular coordinate system is set up along the X Axis based on the coordinate samples contained in the array resource tmXBIrregularPoints. If tmXBIrregularPoints is found to be invalid, a warning is issued and tmXBStyle reverts to Linear. If the data bounds tmXBDataLeftF or tmXBDataRightF are only partially within the range defined by the maximum and minimum elements of tmXBIrregularPoints, a warning is issued and, as appropriate, either tmXBDataLeftF or tmXBDataRightF is reset to the value of the maximum or minimum element of the tmXBIrregularPoints. If the range between tmXBDataLeftF and tmXBDataRightF is entirely outside the range of the tmXBIrregularPoints array, a fatal error is currently issued.  Time:     Not yet implemented.  Geographic:     Not yet implemented.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: Linear 
tmXBTickEndF Sets the ending of the tick marks. Must be greater than tmXBTickStartF. If tmXBTickEndF is less than the maximum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the maximum data extent and tmXBTickEndF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmXBTickSpacingF Used for Manual mode ticks only. Specifies the spacing between major tick marks. If Log style is being used, this value must be the number of decades (i.e. 1 means ticks will be placed and labels at 10**1, 10**2, etc.) Default: 0.0 
tmXBTickStartF Sets the beginning of the tick marks. Must be less than tmXBTickEndF. If tmXBTickStartF is greater than the minimum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the minimum data extent and tmXBTickStartF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmXBValues When tmXBMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which major tick marks will be drawn. The values must increase or decrease monotonically. If you do not set tmXBValues when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and tmXBMode reverts to Automatic mode. When tmXBMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the values that TickMark has chosen for the bottom X Axis major tick locations. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmXMajorGrid Setting True turns on the X Axis major grid; False turns it off. Grid lines will extend the bottom tick marks to the top border. If the bottom ticks are turned off, the top tick marks will be extended to the bottom. Default: False 
tmXMajorGridLineColor Sets color index for major X Axis grid lines. Default: 1 
tmXMajorGridLineDashPattern Sets dash pattern index for the major X Axis grid lines. Default: 0 
tmXMajorGridThicknessF Sets the linewidth scale factor for the thickness of the major X Axis grid lines. Value is a multiple of the device's minimum linewidth. Default: 2.0 
tmXMinorGrid Setting True turns on the X Axis minor grid; False turns it off. Grid lines will extend the bottom tick marks to the top border. If the bottom ticks are turned off, the top tick marks will be extended to the bottom. Default: False 
tmXMinorGridLineColor Sets color index for minor X Axis grid lines. Default: 1 
tmXMinorGridLineDashPattern Sets dash pattern index for minor X Axis grid lines. Default: 0 
tmXMinorGridThicknessF Sets the linewidth scale factor for the minor grid. Value is a multiple of the device's minimum linewidth. Default: 1.0 
tmXTAutoPrecision This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. When True, this boolean resource causes TickMark to set the precision (number of significant digits) for the top tick mark labels based on the range of values used for the labels. In general, the value of tmXTPrecision is ignored. However, if tmXTMode is set to Manual, the precision is set such that all significant digits necessary to express the value of the tmXTTickSpacingF resource are used in determining the precision. In this case, the value of tmXTPrecision sets a cap on the number of significant digits used to express the value of tmXTTickSpacingF. When set False, the value of tmXTPrecision controls the precision. However, if the significant digit conversion field (signaled by the '.' character) is set explicitly in the tmXTFormat string (according to the rules of the Floating Point Format Specification scheme),then the resources tmXTAutoPrecision and tmXTPrecision are both ignored, and the precision is controlled completely by the tmXTFormat specification. Default: True 
tmXTBorderOn Setting True turns top border on; False turns it off. Does not turn off top ticks. Default: True 
tmXTDataLeftF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the data value that maps to the left side of the top tick marks. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmXTDataRightF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the data value that maps to the right side of the top tick marks. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmXTFormat This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. This string resource specifies, according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme, the format of the numbers used to label the major ticks along the top X Axis. It applies only when tmXTMode is set to Automatic or Manual. Unless set explicitly, the significant digits conversion field is set dynamically based on the values of the tmXTAutoPrecision and tmXTPrecision resources. Likewise, the exponent switch length conversion field is set dynamically based on the value of the tmSciNoteCutoff resource. If the leftmost significant digit conversion field has the dynamic attribute set, the assumed leftmost significant digit is set dynamically for each label based on the largest absolute value used to generate the top labels. Combined with the zero format flag, this has the effect of causing all the labels to contain the same number of places to the right of the decimal point. The default format string also sets the "at-sign" ('@') format flag to force fractional values to include an initial '0' character preceding the decimal point. In addition, the exponent conversion field includes, by default, the 's' flag to cause exponents to be written using the superscript notational form. If tmXTStyle is set to Log, exponential notation is forced on, regardless of the character used for the conversion specifier. Also the zero flag is turned off to ensure that the mantissas (which always evaluate to 1.0 because of the spacing enforced for Log style labels) are not turned on because of the need to fill out the significant digits on the right of the decimal point. Default: "0@*+^sg" 
tmXTIrrTensionF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Specifies the value of the tension parameter applied to the spline approximation used to set up an irregular transformation based on the values in the tmXTIrregularPoints array. This resource is only used if tmXTStyle is Irregular. Small values (less than ~1.0) imply a relaxed approximation; large values (greater than ~5.0) imply a tight approximation. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 2.0 
tmXTIrregularPoints This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Used for Irregular style ticks only. Specifies an array of data locations spaced at equal intervals along the top X Axis. These points represent a discrete approximation to the desired coordinate system. These points must be strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing. Therefore, periodic coordinate systems can not be approximated using this resource. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
tmXTLabelAngleF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the counterclockwise rotation of the X-Axis top labels. Default: 0.0 
tmXTLabelConstantSpacingF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. If this resource has the value 0.0, the characters in the top X-Axis label will be proportionally spaced. If it has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of tmXTLabelConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If tmXTLabelConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') placed next to each other. As tmXTLabelConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
tmXTLabelDeltaF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets an offset from the default location for the top tick mark labels. This value multiplied by the tmXTLabelFontHeightF represents the amount, in NDC coordinates, that the top tick marks will be displaced from their default location in the Y direction. A positive value moves labels in the positive direction in NDC coordinates, and a negative value moves labels in the negative direction. Default: 0.0 
tmXTLabelDirection This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the drawing direction of the X-Axis top labels. Default: Across 
tmXTLabelFont This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the font index for the bottom X-Axis labels. Default: 0 
tmXTLabelFontAspectF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the ratio of height/width for the top X-Axis labels. Default: 1.3125 
tmXTLabelFontColor This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the color of the top X-Axis labels. Default: 1 
tmXTLabelFontHeightF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the font height in NDC coordinates for the top X Axis labels. This value changes proportionally to changes in the width of the viewport. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport width of 0.6 
tmXTLabelFontQuality This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the top X-Axis label. Default: High 
tmXTLabelFontThicknessF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the top X-Axis label. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the tmXTLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
tmXTLabelFuncCode This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character for the X-Axis top labels. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default~ : 
tmXTLabelJust This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the justification point for all top X-Axis labels. Default: BottomCenter 
tmXTLabelStride This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Used to skip tick mark labels. The value represents how many tick marks to skip between tick mark labels when drawing the tick mark labels. Will cause the tick mark object to draw first, then skip. Default: 0 
tmXTLabels This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. When tmXTMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of strings that correspond to the values in tmXTValues. Each element of this resource is placed under the corresponding tick location in tmXTValues. If a string array element is set to NULL, no label will appear at the corresponding tick mark location. If you do not set tmXTLabels when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the top X Axis. When tmXTMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the strings that TickMark has chosen as labels for the top X Axis major ticks marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmXTLabelsOn Setting True turns on tick mark labels if tmXTOn is set; False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: False 
tmXTMajorLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the length of the X-Axis top major tick marks in NDC coordinates. The length scales with changes to the viewport height, unless you explicitly set this resource at the same time as the height is changed. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport height of 0.6 
tmXTMajorLineColor This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the line color index for the top major tick marks. Default: 1 
tmXTMajorOutwardLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Length of the major X-Axis top tick marks that will be drawn on the outside of the tick mark border. Value is in NDC coordinates. This value scales proportionally to changes in height. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: 0.0 
tmXTMajorThicknessF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets linewidth scale factor for top major tick marks. Value is a multiple of the minimum linewidth on the current device. Default: 2.0 
tmXTMaxLabelLenF This read-only resource returns the length in NDC of the longest string used as an individual label for the top X Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmXTMaxTicks This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Used for Automatic mode ticks only. Specifies the maximum allowable tick marks for the top X Axis. Default: 7 
tmXTMinLabelSpacingF This read-only resource returns the minimum distance in NDC from the start of one label string to the start of the next label string along the top X Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmXTMinorLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the length in NDC coordinates for X top tick marks. This length scales with changes to the viewport height, unless you explicitly set tmXTMinorLengthF at the same time as you change the height. Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.01 for a viewport height of 0.6 
tmXTMinorLineColor This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets color index for top minor tick marks. Default: 1 
tmXTMinorOn Setting this resource True turns on minor tick marks; False turns them off. Default: True 
tmXTMinorOutwardLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Length of minor X-Axis top tick marks that will be drawn on the outside of the tick mark border. Value is in NDC coordinates. This value scales proportionally to changes in height. Default: 0.0 
tmXTMinorPerMajor This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the number of minor tick marks per major tick mark for the top X Axis. When using Log style tick marks, only the values 1, 4, and 8 are accepted as valid. If the Explicit mode is in effect, TickMark ignores this resource: you must instead specify the spacing of each minor tick individually using tmXTMinorValues. If you do not set this resource and the mode is Automatic, its value is determined dynamically depending on the major tick spacing, as follows: if the major spacing is 1 or 5 times some power of 10, tmXTMinorPerMajor is set to 4; if the spacing is 2 or 4 times a power of 10, it is set to 3; if the spacing is 3 times a power of 10, it is set to 2. Otherwise, if the mode is Manual, tmXTMinorPerMajor defaults to the value 3. Default: <dynamic> 
tmXTMinorThicknessF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets linewidth scale factor for top minor tick marks. Value represents a multiple of the current device's minimum linewidth. Default: 1.0 
tmXTMinorValues This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. When tmXTMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which the minor tick marks will be drawn. If not set, minor tick marks will be absent from the top X Axis. When tmXTMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the locations that TickMark has chosen for the top X Axis minor tick marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. Default: NULL 
tmXTMode This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkMode determines the method for specifying the spacing of the ticks and the contents of the labels along the top X Axis. There are three possible settings: Automatic:     Based on the values of tmXTDataLeftF and tmXTDataRightF, TickMark chooses a 'nice' spacing between the major tick marks, such that the number of major ticks does not exceed the value of tmXTMaxTicks. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmSciNoteCutoff, tmXTAutoPrecision, tmXTPrecision, and tmXTFormat.  Manual:     Starting with the value tmXTTickStartF, TickMark sets major tick marks at intervals separated by a distance of tmXTTickSpacingF until tmXTTickEndF is exceeded. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmXTDataLeftF and tmXTDataRightF may appear along the top X Axis. If tmXTTickStartF and tmXTTickEndF are not set, TickMark issues an informational message and sets tmXTTickStartF to the minimum of tmXTDataLeftF and tmXTDataRightF, and it sets tmXTTickEndF to the maximum of tmXTDataLeftF and tmXTDataRightF. If tmXTTickSpacingF is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmXTMode reverts to Automatic mode. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmXTTickSpacingF, tmSciNoteCutoff, tmXTAutoPrecision, tmXTPrecision, and tmXTFormat.  Explicit:     TickMark uses the array resource tmXTValues to determine the coordinate positions of the tick marks. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmXTDataLeftF and tmXTDataRightF may appear along the top X Axis. If tmXTValues is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmXTMode reverts to Automatic mode. The corresponding element of the string array resource tmXTLabels determines the label used for each tick specified by tmXTValues. If tmXTLabels is not set, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the top X Axis. You may optionally also set the array resource tmXTMinorValues to specify the locations of minor ticks along the axis.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: Automatic 
tmXTOn Setting True turns on top tick marks; False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: True 
tmXTPrecision This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. If tmXTAutoPrecision is set False and the significant digit field in the tmXTFormat string (as specified by the Floating Point Format Specification scheme) has the dynamic attribute set on, this resource controls the precision used for the top tick mark labels. Assuming the default setting of the tmXTFormat resource, the value set for tmXTPrecision will be the number of digits used for the top tick mark label representing the value with the maximum absolute value. The other labels will have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point, but may have fewer digits to the left of the decimal point. All labels will be rounded to the number of decimal places represented. Default: 4 
tmXTStyle This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkStyle sets the style of the TickMark top X Axis. There are 5 styles: Linear:     A linear coordinate system is set up along the X Axis with the left boundary set to the value of tmXTDataLeftF and the right boundary set to the value of tmXTDataRightF. If tmXTDataLeftFand tmXTDataRightF are found to be equal when compared with a precision of 7 significant digits, a warning is issued and the top X-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Log:     A logarithmic coordinate system is set up along the X Axis with the left boundary set to the value of tmXTDataLeftF and the right boundary set to the value of tmXTDataRightF. If either tmXTDataLeftF or tmXTDataRightF is less than or equal to 0.0, a warning is issued and the top X-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Irregular:     An irregular coordinate system is set up along the X Axis based on the coordinate samples contained in the array resource tmXTIrregularPoints. If tmXTIrregularPoints is found to be invalid, a warning is issued and tmXTStyle reverts to Linear. If the data bounds tmXTDataLeftF or tmXTDataRightF are only partially within the range defined by the maximum and minimum elements of tmXTIrregularPoints, a warning is issued and, as appropriate, either tmXTDataLeftF or tmXTDataRightF is reset to the value of the maximum or minimum element of the tmXTIrregularPoints. If the range between tmXTDataLeftF and tmXTDataRightF is entirely outside the range of the tmXTIrregularPoints array, a fatal error is currently issued.  Time:     Not yet implemented.  Geographic:     Not yet implemented.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: Linear 
tmXTTickEndF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the ending of the tick marks. Must be greater than tmXTTickStartF. If tmXTTickEndF is less than the maximum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the maximum data extent and tmXTTickEndF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmXTTickSpacingF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Specifies the spacing between major tick marks. If Log style is being used, this value must be the number of decades (i.e. 1 means ticks will be placed and labels at 10**1, 10**2, etc.) Default: 0.0 
tmXTTickStartF This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. Sets the beginning of the tick marks. Must be less than tmXTTickEndF. If tmXTTickStartF is greater than the minimum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the minimum data extent and tmXTTickStartF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmXTValues This resource is ignored unless tmXUseBottom is set to False. When tmXTMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which major tick marks will be drawn. The values must increase or decrease monotonically. If you do not set tmXTValues when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and tmXTMode reverts to Automatic mode. When tmXTMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the values that TickMark has chosen for the top X Axis major tick locations. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmXUseBottom Causes the top tick marks to use the resources for the bottom tick marks. The resources affected are:     tmXTStyle, tmXTMode, tmXTMinorPerMajor, tmXTDataLeftF, tmXTDataRightF, tmXTTickStartF, tmXTTickEndF, tmXTMaxTicks, tmXTTickSpacingF, tmXTValues, tmXTLabels, tmXTMinorValues, tmXTMajorThicknessF, tmXTMajorLineColor, tmXTMajorLengthF, tmXTMajorOutwardLengthF, tmXTMinorThicknessF, tmXTMinorLineColor, tmXTMinorLengthF, tmXTMinorOutwardLengthF, tmXTLabelFuncCode, tmXTLabelConstantSpacingF, tmXTLabelFont, tmXTLabelFontHeightF, tmXTLabelFontColor, tmXTLabelFontAspectF, tmXTLabelFontThicknessF, tmXTLabelFontQuality, tmXTLabelAngleF, tmXTLabelDirection, tmXTLabelDeltaF, tmXTIrregularPoints, tmXTIrrTensionF, tmXTLabelStride, tmXTAutoPrecision, tmXTPrecision and tmXTFormat.  All other Top TickMark resources are unaffected. Default: True 
tmYLAutoPrecision When True, this boolean resource causes TickMark to set the precision (number of significant digits) for the left tick mark labels based on the range of values used for the labels. In general, the value of tmYLPrecision is ignored. However, if tmYLMode is set to Manual, the precision is set such that all significant digits necessary to express the value of the tmYLTickSpacingF resource are used in determining the precision. In this case, the value of tmYLPrecision sets a cap on the number of significant digits used to express the value of tmYLTickSpacingF. When set False, the value of tmYLPrecision controls the precision. However, if the significant digit conversion field (signaled by the '.' character) is set explicitly in the tmYLFormat string (according to the rules of the Floating Point Format Specification scheme),then the resources tmYLAutoPrecision and tmYLPrecision are both ignored, and the precision is controlled completely by the tmYLFormat specification. Default: True 
tmYLBorderOn Setting True turns left border on and False turns it off. Tick marks will still be drawn unless tmYLOn is False. Default: True 
tmYLDataBottomF The data value that will be mapped to the bottom left corner of the Y axis. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmYLDataTopF The data value that will be mapped to the top left corner of the Y Axis. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmYLFormat This string resource specifies, according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme, the format of the numbers used to label the major ticks along the left Y Axis. It applies only when tmYLMode is set to Automatic or Manual. Unless set explicitly, the significant digits conversion field is set dynamically based on the values of the tmYLAutoPrecision and tmYLPrecision resources. Likewise, the exponent switch length conversion field is set dynamically based on the value of the tmSciNoteCutoff resource. If the leftmost significant digit conversion field has the dynamic attribute set, the assumed leftmost significant digit is set dynamically for each label based on the largest absolute value used to generate the left labels. Combined with the zero format flag, this has the effect of causing all the labels to contain the same number of places to the right of the decimal point. The default format string also sets the "at-sign" ('@') format flag to force fractional values to include an initial '0' character preceding the decimal point. In addition, the exponent conversion field includes, by default, the 's' flag to cause exponents to be written using the superscript notational form. If tmYLStyle is set to Log, exponential notation is forced on, regardless of the character used for the conversion specifier. Also the zero flag is turned off to ensure that the mantissas (which always evaluate to 1.0 because of the spacing enforced for Log style labels) are not turned on because of the need to fill out the significant digits on the right of the decimal point. Default: "0@*+^sg" 
tmYLIrrTensionF Specifies the value of the tension parameter applied to the spline approximation used to set up an irregular transformation based on the values in tmYLIrregularPoints array. This resource is only used if tmYLStyle is Irregular. Small values (less than ~1.0) imply a relaxed approximation; large values (greater than ~5.0) imply a tight approximation. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 2.0 
tmYLIrregularPoints Used for Irregular style ticks only. Specifies an array of data locations spaced at equal intervals along the left Y Axis. These points represent a discrete approximation to the desired coordinate system. These points must be strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing. Therefore, periodic coordinate systems can not be approximated using this resource. approximated using this resource. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
tmYLLabelAngleF Sets the counterclockwise rotation for all Y-Axis tick mark labels. Default: 0.0 
tmYLLabelConstantSpacingF If this resource has the value 0.0, the characters in the left Y-Axis label will be proportionally spaced. If it has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of tmYLLabelConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If tmYLLabelConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') placed next to each other. As tmYLLabelConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
tmYLLabelDeltaF Sets an offset from the default location for the left tick mark labels. This value multiplied by the tmYLLabelFontHeightF represents the amount, in NDC coordinates, that the left tick marks will be displaced from their default location in the X direction. A positive value moves labels in the positive direction in NDC coordinates, and a negative value moves labels in the negative direction. Default: 0.0 
tmYLLabelDirection Sets the drawing direction for all Y-Axis tick mark labels. Default: Across 
tmYLLabelFont Sets the font index to be used for the Y-Axis left tick mark labels. Default: 0 
tmYLLabelFontAspectF Sets the aspect ratio of height/width for each character of the Y-Axis left tick mark labels. Default: 1.3125 
tmYLLabelFontColor Sets the color index for the left Y-Axis tick mark labels. Default: 1 
tmYLLabelFontHeightF Sets the height of the Y-Axis left labels in NDC coordinates. This value scales proportionally to changes in the height of the viewport. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport height of 0.6 
tmYLLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the left Y-Axis label. Default: High 
tmYLLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the left Y-Axis label. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the tmYLLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
tmYLLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character for the Y-Axis left labels. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default~ : 
tmYLLabelJust Sets font justification point for Y-Axis left tick mark labels. Default: CenterRight 
tmYLLabelStride Used to skip tick mark labels. The value represents how many tick marks to skip between tick mark labels when drawing the tick mark labels. Will cause the tick mark object to draw first, then skip. Default: 0 
tmYLLabels When tmYLMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of strings that correspond to the values in tmYLValues. Each element of this resource is placed under the corresponding tick location in tmYLValues. If a string array element is set to NULL, no label will appear at the corresponding tick mark location. If you do not set tmYLLabels when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the left Y Axis. When tmYLMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the strings that TickMark has chosen as labels for the left Y Axis major ticks marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmYLLabelsOn Setting True turns left labels on if tmYLOn is set. False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: True 
tmYLMajorLengthF Sets the length of the Y-Axis left major tick marks in NDC coordinates. The length scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set this resource at the same time as the width is changed. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport width of 0.6 
tmYLMajorLineColor Sets the line color index to be used for drawing the Y-Axis left major tick marks. Default: 1 
tmYLMajorOutwardLengthF Sets the length of the major tick marks that will be drawn outside of the viewport. This value scales proportionally to changes in width. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: 0.0 
tmYLMajorThicknessF Sets the linewidth scale factor to be used for the Y-Axis left major tick marks. Default: 2.0 
tmYLMaxLabelLenF This read-only resource returns the length in NDC of the longest string used as an individual label for the left Y Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmYLMaxTicks Used with Automatic mode. Sets the maximum number of tick marks that will be chosen. Default: 7 
tmYLMinLabelSpacingF This read-only resource returns the minimum distance in NDC from the start of one label string to the start of the next label string along the left Y Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmYLMinorLengthF Sets minor tick mark length for the Y Axis minor tick marks. This length scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set tmYLMinorLengthF at the same time. Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.01 for a viewport height of 0.6. 
tmYLMinorLineColor Sets the color index for the Y Axis minor tick marks. Default: 1 
tmYLMinorOn Turns on minor tick marks when set True; False turns them off. Default: True 
tmYLMinorOutwardLengthF Sets the length of the Y-Axis left minor tick marks that will be drawn outside of the viewport. This value scales proportionally to changes in width. Default: 0.0 
tmYLMinorPerMajor Sets the number of minor tick marks per major tick mark for the left Y Axis. When using Log style tick marks, only the values 1, 4, and 8 are accepted as valid. If the Explicit mode is in effect, TickMark ignores this resource: you must instead specify the spacing of each minor tick individually using tmYLMinorValues. If you do not set this resource and the mode is Automatic, its value is determined dynamically depending on the major tick spacing, as follows: if the major spacing is 1 or 5 times some power of 10, tmYLMinorPerMajor is set to 4; if the spacing is 2 or 4 times a power of 10, it is set to 3; if the spacing is 3 times a power of 10, it is set to 2. Otherwise, if the mode is Manual, tmYLMinorPerMajor defaults to the value 3. Default: <dynamic> 
tmYLMinorThicknessF Sets the linewidth scale factor for the Y Axis minor tick marks. Default: 1.0 
tmYLMinorValues When tmYLMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which the minor tick marks will be drawn. If not set, minor tick marks will be absent from the left Y Axis. When tmYLMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the locations that TickMark has chosen for the left Y Axis minor tick marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. Default: NULL 
tmYLMode This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkMode determines the method for specifying the spacing of the ticks and the contents of the labels along the left Y Axis. It has three possible settings: Automatic:     Based on the values of tmYLDataBottomF and tmYLDataTopF, TickMark chooses a 'nice' spacing between the major tick marks, such that the number of major ticks does not exceed the value of tmYLMaxTicks. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmSciNoteCutoff, tmYLAutoPrecision, tmYLPrecision, and tmYLFormat.  Manual:     Starting with the value tmYLTickStartF, TickMark sets major tick marks at intervals separated by a distance of tmYLTickSpacingF until tmYLTickEndF is exceeded. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmYLDataBottomF and tmYLDataTopF may appear along the left Y Axis. If tmYLTickStartF and tmYLTickEndF are not set TickMark issues an informational message and sets tmYLTickStartF to the minimum of tmYLDataBottomF and tmYLDataTopF, and it sets tmYLTickEndF to the maximum of tmYLDataBottomF and tmYLDataTopF. If tmYLTickSpacingF is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmYLMode reverts to Automatic mode. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmYLTickSpacingF, tmSciNoteCutoff, tmYLAutoPrecision, tmYLPrecision, and tmYLFormat.  Explicit:     TickMark uses the array resource tmYLValues to determine the coordinate positions of the tick marks. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmYLDataBottomF and tmYLDataTopF may appear along the left Y Axis. If tmYLValues is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmYLMode reverts to Automatic mode. The corresponding element of the string array resource tmYLLabels determines the label used for each tick specified by tmYLValues. If tmYLLabels is not set, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the left Y Axis. You may optionally also set the array resource tmYLMinorValues to specify the locations of minor ticks along the axis.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: Automatic 
tmYLOn Setting True turns on the left tick marks, and False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: True 
tmYLPrecision If tmYLAutoPrecision is set False and the significant digit field in the tmYLFormat string (as specified by the Floating Point Format Specification scheme) has the dynamic attribute set on, this resource controls the precision used for the left tick mark labels. Assuming the default setting of the tmYLFormat resource, the value set for tmYLPrecision will be the number of digits used for the left tick mark label representing the value with the maximum absolute value. The other labels will have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point, but may have fewer digits to the left of the decimal point. All labels will be rounded to the number of decimal places represented. Default: 4 
tmYLStyle This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkStyle sets the style of the TickMark left Y Axis. There are 5 styles: Linear:     A linear coordinate system is set up along the Y Axis with the bottom boundary set to the value of tmYLDataBottomF and the top boundary set to the value of tmYLDataTopF. If tmYLDataBottomFand tmYLDataTopF are found to be equal when compared with a precision of 7 significant digits, a warning is issued and the left Y-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Log:     A logarithmic coordinate system is set up along the Y Axis with the bottom boundary set to the value of tmYLDataBottomF and the top boundary set to the value of tmYLDataTopF. If either tmYLDataBottomF or tmYLDataTopF is less than or equal to 0.0, a warning is issued and the left Y-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Irregular:     An irregular coordinate system is set up along the Y Axis based on the coordinate samples contained in the array resource tmYLIrregularPoints. If tmYLIrregularPoints is found to be invalid, a warning is issued and tmYLStyle reverts to Linear. If the data bounds tmYLDataBottomF or tmYLDataTopF are only partially within the range defined by the maximum and minimum elements of tmYLIrregularPoints, a warning is issued and, as appropriate, either tmYLDataBottomF or tmYLDataTopF is reset to the value of the maximum or minimum element of the tmYLIrregularPoints. If the range between tmYLDataBottomF and tmYLDataTopF is entirely outside the range of the tmYLIrregularPoints array, a fatal error is currently issued.  Time:     Not yet implemented.  Geographic:     Not yet implemented.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: Linear 
tmYLTickEndF Sets the ending of the tick marks. Must be greater than tmYLTickStartF. If tmYLTickEndF is less than the maximum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the maximum data extent and tmYLTickEndF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmYLTickSpacingF Used for Manual mode ticks only. Specifies the spacing between major tick marks. If Log style is being used, this value must be the number of decades (i.e. 1 means ticks will be placed and labels at 10**1, 10**2, etc.) Default: 0.0 
tmYLTickStartF Sets the beginning of the tick marks. Must be less than tmYLTickEndF. If tmYLTickStartF is greater than the minimum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the minimum data extent and tmYLTickStartF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmYLValues When tmYLMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which major tick marks will be drawn. The values must increase or decrease monotonically. If you do not set tmYLValues when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and tmYLMode reverts to Automatic mode. When tmYLMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the values that TickMark has chosen for the left Y Axis major tick locations. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmYMajorGrid Setting True turns on the Y Axis grid. Grid lines will extend from the left tick marks to the right border. If the left ticks are turned off, the right tick marks will be extended to the left border. Default: False 
tmYMajorGridLineColor Sets the color index for the Y Axis major grid lines. Default: 1 
tmYMajorGridLineDashPattern Sets the dash pattern for the Y Axis major grid lines. Default: 0 
tmYMajorGridThicknessF Sets the linewidth scale factor for the Y Axis major grid lines. Default: 2.0 
tmYMinorGrid Setting True turns on the Y Axis grid. Grid lines will extend from the left tick marks to the right border. If the left ticks are turned off, the right tick marks will be extended to the left border. Default: False 
tmYMinorGridLineColor Sets the color index for the Y Axis minor grid lines. Default: 1 
tmYMinorGridLineDashPattern Sets the dash pattern index for the Y Axis minor grid lines. Default: 0 
tmYMinorGridThicknessF Sets the linewidth scale factor for the Y Axis minor grid lines. Default: 1.0 
tmYRAutoPrecision This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. When True, this boolean resource causes TickMark to set the precision (number of significant digits) for the right tick mark labels based on the range of values used for the labels. In general, the value of tmYRPrecision is ignored. However, if tmYRMode is set to Manual, the precision is set such that all significant digits necessary to express the value of the tmYRTickSpacingF resource are used in determining the precision. In this case, the value of tmYRPrecision sets a cap on the number of significant digits used to express the value of tmYRTickSpacingF. When set False, the value of tmYRPrecision controls the precision. However, if the significant digit conversion field (signaled by the '.' character) is set explicitly in the tmYRFormat string (according to the rules of the Floating Point Format Specification scheme),then the resources tmYRAutoPrecision and tmYRPrecision are both ignored, and the precision is controlled completely by the tmYRFormat specification. Default: True 
tmYRBorderOn Setting True turns right border on and False turns it off. Tick marks will still be drawn unless tmYROn is False. Default: True 
tmYRDataBottomF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. The data value that will be mapped to the bottom right corner of the Y Axis. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmYRDataTopF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. The data value that will be mapped to the top right corner of the Y Axis. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: 0.0 
tmYRFormat This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. This string resource specifies, according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme, the format of the numbers used to label the major ticks along the right Y Axis. It applies only when tmYRMode is set to Automatic or Manual. Unless set explicitly, the significant digits conversion field is set dynamically based on the values of the tmYRAutoPrecision and tmYRPrecision resources. Likewise, the exponent switch length conversion field is set dynamically based on the value of the tmSciNoteCutoff resource. If the leftmost significant digit conversion field has the dynamic attribute set, the assumed leftmost significant digit is set dynamically for each label based on the largest absolute value used to generate the right labels. Combined with the zero format flag, this has the effect of causing all the labels to contain the same number of places to the right of the decimal point. The default format string also sets the "at-sign" ('@') format flag to force fractional values to include an initial '0' character preceding the decimal point. In addition, the exponent conversion field includes, by default, the 's' flag to cause exponents to be written using the superscript notational form. If tmYRStyle is set to Log, exponential notation is forced on, regardless of the character used for the conversion specifier. Also the zero flag is turned off to ensure that the mantissas (which always evaluate to 1.0 because of the spacing enforced for Log style labels) are not turned on because of the need to fill out the significant digits on the right of the decimal point. Default: "0@*+^sg" 
tmYRIrrTensionF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Specifies the value of the tension parameter applied to the spline approximation used to set up an irregular transformation based on the values in tmYLIrregularPoints array. This resource is only used if tmYLStyle is Irregular. Small values (less than ~1.0) imply a relaxed approximation; large values (greater than ~5.0) imply a tight approximation. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: 2.0 
tmYRIrregularPoints This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Used for Irregular style ticks only. Specifies an array of data locations spaced at equal intervals along the right Y Axis. These points represent a discrete approximation to the desired coordinate system. These points must be strictly monotonically increasing or decreasing. Therefore, periodic coordinate systems can not be approximated using this resource. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
tmYRLabelAngleF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the counterclockwise rotation of all of the right Y-Axis labels. Default: 0.0 
tmYRLabelConstantSpacingF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. If this resource has the value 0.0, the characters in the right Y-Axis label will be proportionally spaced. If it has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of tmYRLabelConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If tmYRLabelConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters (such as 'M' or 'W') placed next to each other. As tmYRLabelConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
tmYRLabelDeltaF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets an offset from the default location for the right tick mark labels. This value multiplied by the tmYRLabelFontHeightF represents the amount, in NDC coordinates, that the right tick marks will be displaced from their default location in the X direction. A positive value moves labels in the positive direction in NDC coordinates, and a negative value moves labels in the negative direction. Default: 0.0 
tmYRLabelDirection This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the drawing direction for the right Y-Axis labels. Default: Across 
tmYRLabelFont This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the font index for the right Y-Axis tick mark labels. Default: 0 
tmYRLabelFontAspectF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the ratio of height/width for the right Y-Axis label characters. Default: 1.3125 
tmYRLabelFontColor This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the color index for right Y-Axis labels. Default: 1 
tmYRLabelFontHeightF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the font height of the Y-Axis right labels in NDC coordinates. This value scales proportionally to changes in viewport height. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport height of 0.6 
tmYRLabelFontQuality This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the right Y-Axis label. Default: High 
tmYRLabelFontThicknessF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the right Y-Axis label. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the tmYRLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
tmYRLabelFuncCode This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character for the Y-Axis right labels. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default~ : 
tmYRLabelJust This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the justification point for the right Y-Axis labels. Default: CenterLeft 
tmYRLabelStride This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Used to skip tick mark labels. The value represents how many tick marks to skip between tick mark labels when drawing the tick mark labels. Will cause the tick mark object to draw first, then skip. Default: 0 
tmYRLabels This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. When tmYRMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of strings that correspond to the values in tmYRValues. Each element of this resource is placed under the corresponding tick location in tmYRValues. If a string array element is set to NULL, no label will appear at the corresponding tick mark location. If you do not set tmYRLabels when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the right Y Axis. When tmYRMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the strings that TickMark has chosen as labels for the right Y Axis major ticks marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmYRLabelsOn Setting True turns right labels on if tmYROn is set. False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: False 
tmYRMajorLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the length of the Y-Axis right major tick marks in NDC coordinates. The length scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set this resource at the same time as the width is changed. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.02 for a viewport width of 0.6 
tmYRMajorLineColor This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the color index for the Y-Axis right major tick marks. Default: 1 
tmYRMajorOutwardLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the length of the Y-Axis right major tick marks that will be drawn outside of the current viewport. This value scales proportionally to changes in width. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: 0.0 
tmYRMajorThicknessF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the linewidth scale factor for the Y-Axis right major tick marks. Default: 2.0 
tmYRMaxLabelLenF This read-only resource returns the length in NDC of the longest string used as an individual label for the right Y Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmYRMaxTicks This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Used with Automatic mode. Sets the maximum number of tick marks that will be drawn. Default: 7 
tmYRMinLabelSpacingF This read-only resource returns the minimum distance in NDC from the start of one label string to the start of the next label string along the right Y Axis. Default: <dynamic> 
tmYRMinorLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the length in NDC coordinates of the Y Axis minor tick marks. This length scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set tmYRMinorLengthF at the same time as you change the width. Default: <dynamic> -- initially 0.01 for a viewport height of 0.6. 
tmYRMinorLineColor This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the line color index for the right Y Axis minor tick marks. Default: 1 
tmYRMinorOn Turns on minor tick marks when set True; False turns them off. Default: True 
tmYRMinorOutwardLengthF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the length of the right Y Axis minor tick marks that will be drawn outside of the viewport. This value scales proportionally to changes in width. Default: 0.0 
tmYRMinorPerMajor This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the number of minor tick marks per major tick mark for the right Y Axis. When using Log style tick marks, only the values 1, 4, and 8 are accepted as valid. If the Explicit mode is in effect, TickMark ignores this resource: you must instead specify the spacing of each minor tick individually using tmYRMinorValues. If you do not set this resource and the mode is Automatic, its value is determined dynamically depending on the major tick spacing, as follows: if the major spacing is 1 or 5 times some power of 10, tmYRMinorPerMajor is set to 4; if the spacing is 2 or 4 times a power of 10, it is set to 3; if the spacing is 3 times a power of 10, it is set to 2. Otherwise, if the mode is Manual, tmYRMinorPerMajor defaults to the value 3. Default: <dynamic> 
tmYRMinorThicknessF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the length of the Y Axis minor tick marks in NDC coordinates. This value scales proportionally to changes in width. Default: 1.0 
tmYRMinorValues This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. When tmYRMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which the minor tick marks will be drawn. If not set, minor tick marks will be absent from the right Y Axis. When tmYRMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the locations that TickMark has chosen for the right Y Axis minor tick marks. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. Default: NULL 
tmYRMode This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkMode determines the method for specifying the spacing of the ticks and the contents of the labels along the right Y Axis. It has three possible settings: Automatic:     Based on the values of tmYRDataBottomF and tmYRDataTopF, TickMark chooses a 'nice' spacing between the major tick marks, such that the number of major ticks does not exceed the value of tmYRMaxTicks. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmSciNoteCutoff, tmYRAutoPrecision, tmYRPrecision, and tmYRFormat.  Manual:     Starting with the value tmYRTickStartF, TickMark sets major tick marks at intervals separated by a distance of tmYRTickSpacingF until tmYRTickEndF is exceeded. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmYRDataBottomF and tmYRDataTopF may appear along the right Y Axis. If tmYRTickStartF and tmYRTickEndF are not set, TickMark issues an informational message and sets tmYRTickStartF to the minimum of tmYRDataBottomF and tmYRDataTopF, and it sets tmYRTickEndF to the maximum of tmYRDataBottomF and tmYRDataTopF. If tmYRTickSpacingF is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmYRMode reverts to Automatic mode. Labels are generated based on the current settings of tmYRTickSpacingF, tmSciNoteCutoff, tmYRAutoPrecision, tmYRPrecision, and tmYRFormat.  Explicit:     TickMark uses the array resource tmYRValues to determine the coordinate positions of the tick marks. Of these tick marks, only those that fall between tmYRDataBottomF and tmYRDataTopF may appear along the right Y Axis. If tmYRValues is not set, TickMark issues a warning message and tmYRMode reverts to Automatic mode. The corresponding element of the string array resource tmYRLabels determines the label used for each tick specified by tmYRValues. If tmYRLabels is not set, TickMark issues a warning and outputs no labels for the right Y Axis. You may optionally also set the array resource tmYRMinorValues to specify the locations of minor ticks along the axis.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: Automatic 
tmYROn Setting True turns on the right tick marks, and False turns them off. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: True 
tmYRPrecision This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. If tmYRAutoPrecision is set False and the significant digit field in the tmYRFormat string (as specified by the Floating Point Format Specification scheme) has the dynamic attribute set on, this resource controls the precision used for the right tick mark labels. Assuming the default setting of the tmYRFormat resource, the value set for tmYRPrecision will be the number of digits used for the right tick mark label representing the value with the maximum absolute value. The other labels will have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point, but may have fewer digits to the left of the decimal point. All labels will be rounded to the number of decimal places represented. Default: 4 
tmYRStyle This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. This enumerated resource of type NhlTTickMarkStyle sets the style of the TickMark right Y Axis. There are 5 styles: Linear:     A linear coordinate system is set up along the Y Axis with the bottom boundary set to the value of tmYRDataBottomF and the top boundary set to the value of tmYRDataTopF. If tmYRDataBottomFand tmYRDataTopF are found to be equal when compared with a precision of 7 significant digits, a warning is issued and the right Y-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Log:     A logarithmic coordinate system is set up along the Y Axis with the bottom boundary set to the value of tmYRDataBottomF and the top boundary set to the value of tmYRDataTopF. If either tmYRDataBottomF or tmYRDataTopF is less than or equal to 0.0, a warning is issued and the left Y-Axis tick marks are turned off.  Irregular:     An irregular coordinate system is set up along the Y Axis based on the coordinate samples contained in the array resource tmYRIrregularPoints. If tmYRIrregularPoints is found to be invalid, a warning is issued and tmYRStyle reverts to Linear. If the data bounds tmYRDataBottomF or tmYRDataTopF are only partially within the range defined by the maximum and minimum elements of tmYRIrregularPoints, a warning is issued and, as appropriate, either tmYRDataBottomF or tmYRDataTopF is reset to the value of the maximum or minimum element of the tmYRIrregularPoints. If the range between tmYRDataBottomF and tmYRDataTopF is entirely outside the range of the tmYRIrregularPoints array, a fatal error is currently issued.  Time:     Not yet implemented.  Geographic:     Not yet implemented.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     PlotManager  Default: Linear 
tmYRTickEndF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the ending of the tick marks. Must be greater than tmYRTickStartF. If tmYRTickEndF is less than the maximum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the maximum data extent and tmYRTickEndF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmYRTickSpacingF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Specifies the spacing between major tick marks. If Log style is being used, this value must be the number of decades (i.e. 1 means ticks will be placed and labels at 10**1, 10**2, etc.) Default: 0.0 
tmYRTickStartF This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. Sets the beginning of the tick marks. Must be less than tmYRTickEndF. If tmYRTickStartF is greater than the minimum data extent, no tick marks will be drawn between the minimum data extent and tmYRTickStartF. Used for Manual mode ticks only. Default: 0.0 
tmYRValues This resource is ignored unless tmYUseLeft is set to False. When tmYRMode is set to Explicit, this resource specifies an array of data locations at which major tick marks will be drawn. The values must increase or decrease monotonically. If you do not set tmYRValues when in Explicit mode, TickMark issues a warning and tmYRMode reverts to Automatic mode. When tmYRMode is set to Automatic or Manual, you can retrieve this resource to determine the values that TickMark has chosen for the right Y Axis major tick locations. Attempts to set the resource, however, are ignored. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     MapPlot  Default: NULL 
tmYUseLeft Causes the right tick marks to use the resources for the left tick marks. The resources affected are     tmYRStyle, tmYRMode, tmYRMinorPerMajor, tmYRDataBottomF, tmYRDataTopF, tmYRTickStartF, tmYRTickEndF, tmYRMaxTicks, tmYRTickSpacingF, tmYRValues, tmYRLabels, tmYRMinorValues, tmYRMajorThicknessF, tmYRMajorLineColor, tmYRMajorLengthF, tmYRMajorOutwardLengthF, tmYRMinorThicknessF, tmYRMinorLineColor, tmYRMinorLengthF, tmYRMinorOutwardLengthF, tmYRLabelFuncCode, tmYRLabelConstantSpacingF, tmYRLabelFont, tmYRLabelFontHeightF, tmYRLabelFontColor, tmYRLabelFontAspectF, tmYRLabelFontThicknessF, tmYRLabelFontQuality, tmYRLabelAngleF, tmYRLabelDirection, tmYRLabelDeltaF, tmYRIrregularPoints, tmYRIrrTensionF, tmYRLabelStride, tmYRAutoPrecision, tmYRPrecision, and tmYRFormat.  All other Right TickMark resources are unaffected. Default: True 
trGridType (Transformation) This resource of type NhlTGridType directly correlates with the Transformation subclass used to map a plot object's data into its coordinate space. By default the Transformation is predetermined based on the plot object type and the form of the data that is sent to it. However, for the ContourPlot object, you can choose to use the TriangularMeshTransformation to plot any kind of data, or if ScalarField or VectorField data has 2D coordinate arrays, you can pick from as many as three Transformation subclasses. In these cases there is not a simple test that can automatically determine the most suitable class to use. trGridType has five possible values: Map     Specifies the MapTransformation.  LogLin     Specifies the LogLinTransformation.  Irregular     Specifies the IrregularTransformation.  Curvilinear     Specifies the CurvilinearTransformation.  Spherical     Specifies the SphericalTransformation.  TriangularMesh     Specifies the TriangularMeshTransformation.  trGridType is for the most part a read-only resource, except when the data grid is defined using 2D coordinate arrays or in the case of the ContourPlot whenever TriangularMesh is specified. When 2D coordinates are in effect, trGridType defaults to Spherical but you may set it Curvilinear or TriangularMesh if the plot class supports it. For a ContourPlot you may specify TriangularMesh for any type of data grid. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     MapTransformation     XyPlot  Default: <dynamic> 
trLineInterpolationOn (Transformation) This resource controls the rendering of the lines between defined points for XyPlot and for graphics primitives drawn using NhlDataPolyline or NhlDataPolygon. If set False, lines between the points are drawn as straight lines in NDC space. If set True, points are interpolated between the defined points in order to map the line into the data space. This resource is disabled by:     MapTransformation  V4.1.1 Status Note 1 Default: False 
trXAxisType (IrregularTransformation) This resource of type NhlTAxisType sets the type of transformation used for the X Axis. It has three possible settings: IrregularAxis     Based on the values of the trXCoordPoints resource (and possibly the trXInterPoints resource), an irregular coordinate system is defined along the X Axis. If trXCoordPoints is unset or found to be invalid, a warning will be issued and trXAxisType will be reset to its default value: LinearAxis.  LogAxis     A logarithmic coordinate system is established for the X Axis with boundaries defined by the values of trXMinF and trXMaxF. If trXMinF is less than or equal to 0.0, a warning will be issued and trXAxisType will be reset to its default value: LinearAxis.  LinearAxis     A linear coordinate system is established for the X Axis with boundaries defined by the values of trXMinF and trXMaxF.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: LinearAxis 
trXCoordPoints (IrregularTransformation) If trXInterPoints is not set, this array resource represents uniformly spaced samples of a bounded irregularly spaced data coordinate system along the X Axis. The elements of the array must be arranged in a monotonically increasing or decreasing order. The coordinate system bounds are defined as the values of the minimum and maximum elements of the array: in other words, its first and last elements. If you superimpose on this coordinate system a regular coordinate system such that the left end is 0 and the right end is the number of elements in the array minus 1, then each succeeding array element value represents the coordinate value of the irregular coordinate system at successive integral coordinate points (0, 1, 2, ...) of the overlaid regular coordinate system. Note that these integral coordinates correspond directly to the array element index (with an offset of 1 when using a Fortran interface). Based on this mapping, the IrregularTransformation sets up both a forward and a reverse transformation. trXCoordPoints is ignored unless trXAxisType is set to IrregularAxis. If the array contains less than two points or is non-monotonic, a warning will be issued and trXAxisType will be reset to its default value: LinearAxis. V4.1 Status Note 2 This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: NULL 
trXInterPoints (IrregularTransformation) This array resource, which, if set, must contain the same number of points as trXCoordPoints, adds another step to the mapping from regular to irregular coordinates. As in the case when trXInterPoints is not set, you superimpose a bounded regular coordinate system on the irregular coordinate system. Successive elements of trXInterPoints, like those of trXCoordPoints, must increase or decrease monotonically. However, the element values have a range defined by the bounds of the superimposed regular coordinate system (0 through array size - 1). Now the location of the data coordinate point specified by each successive element of the trXCoordPoints is determined, not by direct correlation with its array index, but by the value of the corresponding element of the trXInterPoints array. trXInterPoints is ignored unless trXAxisType is set to IrregularAxis. If trXInterPoints is found to be invalid, IrregularTransformation issues a warning message and computes the coordinate transformation as if it had not been set. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: NULL 
trXLog (LogLinTransformation) If this boolean resource is True, the X-Axis coordinate system is logarithmic; otherwise it is linear. When this value is set True, both trXMinF and trXMaxF are required to be greater than 0.0. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: False 
trXMaxF (Transformation) Specifies a maximum X coordinate value that defines the upper bound of the X-Axis coordinate system. If trXMaxF is less than trXMinF, the values will be exchanged before they are used to establish coordinate boundaries. If the axis is irregular, trXMaxF is constrained to lie within the bounds of the irregular coordinate system as established by the X-Axis coordinate array. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot     MapTransformation  Default: 1.0 
trXMinF (Transformation) Specifies a minimum X coordinate value that defines the lower bound of the X-Axis coordinate system. If trXMinF is greater than trXMaxF, the values will be exchanged before they are used to establish coordinate boundaries. If the axis is logarithmic, trXMinF must be greater than 0.0. If the axis is irregular, trXMinF is constrained to lie within the bounds of the irregular coordinate system as established by the X-Axis coordinate array. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot     MapTransformation  Default: 0.0 
trXReverse (Transformation) If the axis is linear or logarithmic, setting trXReverse True results in a coordinate system that increases from right to left, rather than in the usual direction from left to right. If the axis is irregular, setting trXReverse True results in a reversal of the direction of increasing coordinates as initially defined by the ordering of the elements of the X-Axis coordinate array. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     MapTransformation  Default: False 
trXSamples (IrregularTransformation) Specifies the number of sample points over the X-Axis coordinate system that IrregularTransformation is to use in order to determine the reverse transformation. More sample points (usually) increase the accuracy of the reverse transformation, but at the cost of greater processing time for every transformation calculated. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: 9 
trXTensionF (IrregularTransformation) Specifies the value of the tension parameter applied to the spline approximation used to set up the irregular transformation for the X Axis coordinate system. Small values (less than ~1.0) imply a relaxed approximation; large values (greater than ~5.0) imply a tight approximation. Note that large values of this parameter (>~10.0) may cause the transformation to become unstable or even fail. Default: 2.0 
trYAxisType (IrregularTransformation) This resource of type NhlTAxisType sets the type of transformation used for the Y Axis. It has three possible settings: IrregularAxis     Based on the values of the trYCoordPoints resource (and possibly the trYInterPoints resource), an irregular coordinate system is defined along the Y Axis. If trYCoordPoints is unset or found to be invalid, a warning will be issued and trYAxisType will be reset to its default value: LinearAxis.  LogAxis     A logarithmic coordinate system is established for the Y Axis with boundaries defined by the values of trYMinF and trYMaxF. If trYMinF is less than or equal to 0.0, a warning will be issued and trYAxisType will be reset to its default value: LinearAxis.  LinearAxis     A linear coordinate system is established for the Y Axis with boundaries defined by the values of trYMinF and trYMaxF.  This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: LinearAxis 
trYCoordPoints (IrregularTransformation) If trYInterPoints is not set, this array resource represents uniformly spaced samples of a bounded, irregularly spaced data coordinate system along the Y Axis. The elements of the array must be arranged in a monotonically increasing or decreasing order. The coordinate system bounds are defined as the values of the minimum and maximum elements of the array: in other words, its first and last elements. If you superimpose on this coordinate system a regular coordinate system such that the bottom end is 0 and the top end is the number of elements in the array minus 1, then each succeeding array element value represents the coordinate value of the irregular coordinate system at successive integral coordinate points (0, 1, 2, ...) of the overlaid regular coordinate system. Note that these integral coordinates correspond directly to the array element index (with an offset of 1 when using a Fortran interface). Based on this mapping, the IrregularTransformation sets up both a forward and a reverse transformation. trYCoordPoints is ignored unless trYAxisType is set to IrregularAxis. If the array contains less than two points or is non-monotonic, a warning will be issued and trYAxisType will be reset to its default value: LinearAxis. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  V4.1 Status Note 2 Default: NULL 
trYInterPoints (IrregularTransformation) This array resource, which, if set, must contain the same number of points as trYCoordPoints, adds another step to the mapping from regular to irregular coordinates. As in the case when trYInterPoints is not set, you superimpose a bounded regular coordinate system on the irregular coordinate system. Successive elements of trYInterPoints, like those of trYCoordPoints, must increase or decrease monotonically. However, the element values have a range defined by the bounds of the superimposed regular coordinate system (0 through array size -1). Now the location of the data coordinate point specified by each successive element of the trYCoordPoints is determined, not by direct correlation with its array index, but by the value of the corresponding element of the trYInterPoints array. trYInterPoints is ignored unless trYAxisType is set to IrregularAxis. If trYInterPoints is found to be invalid, IrregularTransformation issues a warning message and computes the coordinate transformation as if it had not been set. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: NULL 
trYLog (LogLinTransformation) If this boolean resource is True, the Y-Axis coordinate system is logarithmic; otherwise it is linear. When this value is set True, both trYMinF and trYMaxF are required to be greater than 0.0. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: False 
trYMaxF (Transformation) Specifies a maximum Y coordinate value that defines the upper bound of the Y-Axis coordinate system. If trYMaxF is less than trYMinF, the values will be exchanged before they are used to establish coordinate boundaries. If the axis is irregular, trYMaxF is constrained to lie within the bounds of the irregular coordinate system as established by the Y-Axis coordinate array. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot     MapTransformation  Default: 1.0 
trYMinF (Transformation) Specifies a minimum Y coordinate value that defines the lower bound of the Y-Axis coordinate system. If trYMinF is greater than trYMaxF, the values will be exchanged before they are used to establish coordinate boundaries. If the axis is logarithmic, trYMinF must be greater than 0.0. If the axis is irregular, trYMinF is constrained to lie within the bounds of the irregular coordinate system as established by the Y-Axis coordinate array. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot     MapTransformation  Default: 0.0 
trYReverse (Transformation) If the axis is linear or logarithmic, setting trYReverse to True results in a coordinate system that increases from top to bottom, rather than in the usual direction from bottom to top. If the axis is irregular, setting trYReverse to True results in a reversal of the direction of increasing coordinates as initially defined by the ordering of the elements of the Y-Axis coordinate array. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     MapTransformation  Default: False 
trYSamples (IrregularTransformation) Specifies the number of sample points over the Y-Axis coordinate system that IrregularTransformation is to use in order to determine the reverse transformation. More sample points (usually) increase the accuracy of the reverse transformation, but at the cost of greater processing time for every transformation calculated. This resource may be intercepted or disabled by:     ContourPlot     StreamlinePlot     VectorPlot     XyPlot  Default: 9 
trYTensionF (IrregularTransformation) Specifies the value of the tension parameter applied to the spline approximation used to set up the irregular transformation for the Y Axis coordinate system. Small values (less than ~1.0) imply a relaxed approximation; large values (greater than ~5.0) imply a tight approximation. Note that large values of this parameter (>~10.0) may cause the transformation to become unstable or even fail. Default: 2.0 
txAngleF Sets the rotation angle of the text around the justification point. The angle is counterclockwise and 0 degrees is horizontal on the screen. Default: 0.0 
txBackgroundFillColor When txPerimOn is True, txBackgroundFillColor sets the background color used as solid fill of the box defined by the TextItem perimeter. To leave the box unfilled, set txBackgroundFillColor to Transparent (-1). Default: Transparent 
txConstantSpacingF If this resource has the value 0.0, TextItem draws characters with proportional spacing; in other words, each character is spaced according to its width relative to other characters in the font. If txConstantSpacingF has a value greater than 0.0, the distance from the beginning of one character to the beginning of the next character will be constant. The value of txConstantSpacingF sets this constant distance as a multiple of the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. If txConstantSpacingF has the value 1.0, the constant distance will cause there to be almost no space between two wide characters such as 'M' placed next to each other. As txConstantSpacingF decreases from 1.0, characters will begin to overlap. As it increases from 1.0, characters become further separated from each other. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
txDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text drawn by the TextItem. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These descriptions apply before any rotation due to txAngleF is applied to the TextItem. Default: Across 
txFont When the txFontQuality resource has the value High, this resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used for the TextItem. The fonts may be categorized into two types according to the way their characters are rendered: they are either stroked using lines or filled as areas. Only the stroked fonts are affected by the resource, txFontThicknessF, which sets the thickness of the stroking line. When txFontQuality is set to Medium or Low, the txFont resource is ignored. The default font, the pwritx_database font (font index 0), differs from all other fonts in that it intrinsically contains many more characters than the other fonts (564 as opposed to somewhere between 97 and 128). A number of the Text Function Codes allow special access to the characters of the pwritx_database font. You may use either the integer index or the string font name to specify a value for txFont. Note that whenever you change a font, the low-level NCAR Graphics library must read in the new font data from a file. The following table lists each fonts by index and name, and also indicates the rendering method used for the font: +-------------------------------------------------------+ |HLU Fonts| |      -------------------------------------------------------| | INDEX|  TYPE| NAME| |================================================      =======| |  0| stroked| pwritx_database| |-----------------    --------------------------------------| |  1| stroked| default     | |-------------------------------------------------------| |  2| stroked| cartographic_roman| |-------------------------------    ------------------------| |  3| stroked| cartographic_greek|        |-------------------------------------------------------| |  4|  stroked| simplex_roman| |--------------------------------------    -----------------| |  5| stroked| simplex_greek| |--------     -----------------------------------------------| |  6| stroked| s  implex_script   | |-------------------------------------------------------| |  7| stroked| complex_roman| |-------------------     ------------------------------------| |  8| stroked| complex_gree  k| |-------------------------------------------------------|       |  9| stroked| complex_script| |------------------------------    -------------------------| | 10| stroked| complex_italic| |    -------------------------------------------------------| | 11  | stroked| complex_cyrillic| |-----------------------------------------   --------------| | 12  | stroked| duplex_roman| |-----------    --------------------------------------------| | 13  | stroked| tri plex_roman| |---------------------------------------------------   ----| | 14  | stroked| triplex_italic| |--------------------   -----------------------------------| | 15  | stroked| gothic_germa n| |-------------------------------------------------------|       | 16  | stroked| gothic_english| |-----------------------------   --------------------------| | 17  | stroked| gothic_italian|       |-------------------------------------------------------| | 18  | stroked| math_symbols| |-----------------------------------------    --------------| | 19  | stroked| symbol_set1| |------------    -------------------------------------------| | 20  | stroked| symb ol_set2| |------------------------------------------------------   -| | 21| filled| helvetica| |-----------------------------     --------------------------| | 22| filled| helvetica-bold| |    -------------------------------------------------------| | 25| fil led| times-roman| |--------------------------------------------    -----------| | 26| filled| times-bold| |------------------     -------------------------------------| | 29| filled| courier|         |-------------------------------------------------------| | 30 | filled| courier-bold| |----------------------------------------    ---------------| | 33| filled| greek| |------------------      -------------------------------------| | 34| filled| math-symbols     | |-------------------------------------------------------| | 35| filled| text-symbols| |--------------------------------------     -----------------| | 36| filled| weather1| |--------------     -----------------------------------------| | 37| filled| weather2     | +-------------------------------------------------------+ Default: 0 
txFontAspectF This resource sets the aspect ratio, defined as the height divided by the width of a reference character box within which all characters of the font will fit. Its value determines the width of the characters relative to txFontHeightF. If given the value 1.0, wide characters such as 'M' will be approximately square in shape. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters, while values decreasing from 1.0 result in wider characters. Default: 1.3125 
txFontColor Integer value that is an index into parent workstations color map. Default: 1 
txFontHeightF Height of text from bottom of average character to top of average character in NDC coordinates. Default: .05 
txFontOpacityF Sets the opacity of text drawn as graphics on a plot. Specify a floating-point value in the range of 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
txFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the TextItem. There are three choices: High     Draw characters using any of the stoked or filled fonts.  Medium     Draw characters using a 94 character stroked font that is simpler than the High quality fonts, resulting in somewhat smaller metafiles. The txFont resource is ignored.  Low     The characters are output as a string into the metafile. The quality of the output therefore depends on the fonts available to the metafile translator. When NCAR translators are used the font quality is similar to that of Medium text. The txFont resource is ignored.  Default: High 
txFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the lines used to draw the characters of the TextItem. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the txFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
txFuncCode Specifies the character used to delimit Text Function Codes embedded in the TextItem string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
txJust This resource of type NhlTJustification sets the justification point of the TextItem. Default: CenterCenter 
txPerimColor When txPerimOn is True, txPerimColor specifies the HLU color index used for the line around the perimeter of the text. Default: Foreground 
txPerimDashLengthF When txPerimOn is True, txPerimDashLengthF specifies the length of each segment of the dash pattern used to draw the perimeter line around the TextItem. Default: 0.15 
txPerimDashPattern When txPerimOn is True, txPerimDashPattern specifies the HLU index of the dash pattern used to draw the perimeter line around the TextItem. Default: 0 
txPerimOn This boolean resource that determines whether the TextItem draws a box around the perimeter of the text. The box may or may not have a solid fill background. Default: False 
txPerimSpaceF When txPerimOn is True, txPerimSpaceF determines the spacing or margin between the text of the TextItem and perimeter outline as a fraction of the current txFontHeightF. Default: 0.5 
txPerimThicknessF When txPerimOn is True, txPerimThicknessF specifies the thickness of the perimeter line around the TextItem. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
txPosXF Is the X location of the justification point in NDC coordinates. Default: <dynamic> If the View resources are used to position the TextItem then this resource will be determined from that placement, otherwise its default is 0.0. 
txPosYF Is the Y location of the justification point in NDC coordinates. Default: <dynamic> If the View resources are used to position the TextItem then this resource will be determined from that placement, otherwise its default is 1.0. 
txString Specifies the string that the TextItem is to draw. The string may contain Text Function Codes that allow you to control typographical attributes such as subscripting and superscripting, change fonts within a string, embed newlines, etc. Default: <dynamic> If this resource is not set, then the default value for this resource will be the name of the TextItem object. 
vcExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn This boolean resource allows you control the labels that appear in the VectorPlot LabelBar explicitly. When set True, VectorPlot does not block the LabelBar resources lbLabelStrings and lbLabelAlignment. Therefore you can directly control both the contents of the LabelBar's label strings and their alignment with respect to the label boxes. When vcExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn is set False, VectorPlot sets both of these resources based on the current vector line labels and the value of the resource vcLabelBarEndLabelsOn. If you set this resource True but do not set the lbLabelStrings array resource, VectorPlot will set it for you one time. This allows you to get an initial set of strings as a starting point for any customization you want to perform. Default: False 
vcFillArrowEdgeColor When vcMonoFillArrowEdgeColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets a uniform color index for the edges of all filled vector arrows. If set to Transparent (-1), the edge line will not be drawn at all for filled vectors, assuming the fill color index is set to a value other than Transparent. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: Background 
vcFillArrowEdgeThicknessF This resource sets the thickness of the lines used to form the edges of filled vector arrows. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. If vcFillOverEdge is set True, note that the edge will not fully appear unless it is drawn using thickness greater than 1.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 2.0 
vcFillArrowFillColor When vcMonoFillArrowFillColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets a uniform fill color index for all filled vector arrows. If set to Transparent (-1), the arrow will not be filled at all and only the perimeter will be drawn. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: Foreground 
vcFillArrowHeadInteriorXF This resource specifies the distance from the point of the arrowhead of a filled vector arrow drawn at the reference length to the point where the arrowhead joins with the line extending to the tail of the arrow. The value represents a fraction of the value of vcRefLengthF. (See figure.) This distance is adjusted proportionally to the X component of the arrowhead size for all vector arrows. The value of vcFillArrowHeadInteriorXF is constrained to the range 0.0 through 1.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 0.33 
vcFillArrowHeadMinFracXF This resource specifies the X component of the arrowhead size for a filled arrow drawn at the minimum length, as a fraction of the component length specified by vcFillArrowHeadXF. (See figure.) If given the value 1.0, the arrowhead X component will be the same for all arrows in the plot, regardless of their length. The value of vcFillArrowHeadMinFracXF is constrained to the range 0.0 through 1.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 0.25 
vcFillArrowHeadMinFracYF This resource, when added to the minimum width value, specifies the Y component length of the arrowhead size for a filled arrow drawn at the minimum length, as a fraction of the component length specified by vcFillArrowHeadYF. (See figure.) If given the value 1.0, the arrowhead Y component will extend the same distance perpendicularly from the edge of all arrows in the plot, regardless of their length and width. This can be a useful resource to adjust to ensure that the points of even very short vector arrows remain visible. The value of vcFillArrowHeadMinFracYF is constrained to the range 0.0 through 1.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 0.25 
vcFillArrowHeadXF This resource specifies the distance from the point of the arrowhead of a filled vector arrow drawn at the reference length to its back tips along the centerline of the arrow. The value represents a fraction of the value of vcRefLengthF and determines the X component of the arrowhead size. (See figure.) If vcFillArrowHeadMinFracXF has the value 0.0, then the ratio of the X component of the arrowhead size to the arrow length will be invariant for all vectors in the plot. The value of vcFillArrowHeadXF is constrained to the range 0.0 through 2.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 0.36 
vcFillArrowHeadYF This resource specifies the perpendicular distance from one side of a filled vector arrow drawn at the reference length to one of the back tips of the arrowhead. The value represents a fraction of the value of vcRefLengthF and, when added to half the arrow width, determines the Y component of the arrowhead size. (See figure.) If both vcFillArrowHeadMinFracYF and vcFillArrowMinFracWidthF have the value 0.0, then the ratio of the Y component of the arrowhead size to the arrow length will be invariant for all vectors in the plot. The value of vcFillArrowHeadYF is constrained to the range 0.0 through 1.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 0.12 
vcFillArrowMinFracWidthF This resource specifies the width of a filled arrow drawn at the minimum length, as a fraction of the width specified by vcFillArrowWidthF. (See figure.) If given the value 1.0, all arrows in the plot will be drawn at the same width, regardless of their length. The value of vcFillArrowMinFracWidthF is constrained to the range 0.0 through 1.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 0.25 
vcFillArrowWidthF This resource specifies the width of a filled vector arrow drawn at the reference length as a fraction of vcRefLengthF. (See figure.) If vcFillArrowMinFracWidthF has the value 0.0, then the ratio of the arrow width to the arrow length will be invariant for all arrows in the plot. The value of vcFillArrowWidthF is constrained to the range 0.0 through 1.0. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: 0.1 
vcFillArrowsOn vcGlyphStyle overrides and eventually is intended to replace this resource. However, if you set vcFillArrowsOn and do not at the same time set vcGlyphStyle, you can use it to select between the LineArrow and FillArrow glyph styles. When set True, fill arrows are selected; when set False, line arrows are selected. Default: False 
vcFillOverEdge If this boolean resource is set True, the perimeter outline of a filled vector arrow is drawn first, underneath the fill. In this case, the line must be drawn using a line thickness greater than 1.0 in order for the line to appear. The advantage of drawing the line underneath is that the full extent of the fill appears; when the line is drawn on top of the fill using a different color index, the fill color may be partially or completely obscured, especially for small vector arrows. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: True 
vcGlyphOpacityF Sets the opacity of vector glyphs in a plot. Specify a floating-point value between 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). Default: 1.0 
vcGlyphStyle This resource selects the style of glyph used to represent the vector magnitude and direction. There are four choices: LineArrow     Vectors are represented using an arrow-shaped polyline pointing in the direction of the vector. The arrow length and head size may vary with the magnitude of the vector. Resources prefixed by vcLineArrow... have an effect when vcGlyphStyle is set to this value.  FillArrow     Vectors are represented using a polygon and possibly a polyline edge that point in the direction of the vector. The length, width, and various parameters affecting the head size and overall shape may vary with the magnitude of the vector. Resources prefixed by vcFillArrow... have an effect when vcGlyphStyle is set to this value.  WindBarb     Vectors are represented using a standard wind barb glyph, composed of a shaft parallel to the vector direction, and pennants and/or ticks spaced at even intervals along the shaft starting at the end nearest the direction from which the flow is coming. (For the purposes of the vcPositionMode resource, this end is the "tail" of the wind barb.) If the velocity is less than 2.5 in magnitude, a circle is drawn instead of the barbed shaft. Otherwise half ticks represent 5 units of magnitude, full ticks represent 10 units, and pennants represent 50 units. By convention, the units usually represent knots. The pennants are drawn using a filled polygon, while the ticks, the shaft, and the calm circle are all rendered with polylines. Unlike the other glyph styles, wind barbs maintain a basically uniform length for all magnitudes. Resources prefixed by vcWindBarb... have an effect when vcGlyphStyle is set to this value.  CurlyVector     Vector are represented using a curved polyline tangent to the instantaneous flow in the neighborhood of the grid point. A variably-sized arrowhead at one end of the line points in the direction of the flow. The path length of the curve may vary with the vector magnitude at the grid point location. CurlyVector mode is like LineArrow mode in that it is rendered using a polyline, and therefore resources prefixed by vcLineArrow... have an effect when vcGlyphStyle is set to this value. Unlike the other glyph styles, when vectors drawn with this style are colored, the color varies along the path length of the vector depending on the interpolated value of the magnitude or other scalar field at each step along the path.  This resource overrides and eventually is intended to replace the resource vcFillArrowsOn. vcFillArrowsOn can still be used to choose between line arrows and fill arrows, as long as you do not set vcGlyphStyle at the same time. Default: LineArrow 
vcLabelBarEndLabelsOn When this boolean resource is set True and vcExplicitLabelBarLabelsOn is False, VectorPlot creates labels for the two ends of the LabelBar. The label at one end will be a string representation of a minimum value and at the other end will be a string representation of the maximum value. These values represent either a vector magnitude or, if vcUseScalarArray is set True, some other scalar value. Both strings will be formatted according to the format specification in effect for the other labels provided by VectorPlot to the LabelBar. Default: False 
vcLabelFontColor If vcLabelsUseVectorColor is set False, this resource specifies the HLU color index used to draw the vector magnitude labels. Default: Foreground 
vcLabelFontHeightF This resource specifies the NDC height of characters used for vector magnitude labels. The label font height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set vcLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> 
vcLabelsOn If this resource is set True, VectorPlot will place labels representing the vector magnitude next to each arrow in the vector field plot. These labels are primarily intended as a debugging aid, since in order to avoid excessive overlap, you must typically set the label text size too small to be readable without magnification. For this reason, only a few resources are available to control the appearance of these labels. They are rendered using low quality text. Default: False 
vcLabelsUseVectorColor If this resource is set True, VectorPlot draws the vector magnitude labels using the color of the corresponding vector. Otherwise the labels are drawn using the color index specified by vcLabelFontColor. Default: False 
vcLevelColors The elements of this array of type NhlTColorIndexGenArray can be set using an array of color indexes, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If vcGlyphStyle is set to LineArrow or CurlyVector and vcMonoLineArrowColor is False, this resource controls the color of the line-drawn vector arrows. If vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow, then this resource may control the fill and/or the edge color of the filled vector arrows, depending on the values of the resources vcMonoFillArrowFillColor and vcMonoFillArrowEdgeColor. If vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb and vcMonoWindBarbColor is False, this resource controls the color of the wind barb glyphs. Each element of vcLevelColors specifies a color for vectors whose associated scalar data value is less than the corresponding element of the vcLevels array. Note that there is always one more color than there are vector levels. The first element of vcLevelColors specifies a color index for any vector with an associated data value less than the value of vcMinLevelValF. The highest currently used element of vcLevelColors specifies a color for vectors with associated data values greater than the value of vcMaxLevelValF. When vcGlyphStyle is set to CurlyVector, the vectors appear multicolored with the color varying along the path length of the vector depending on the interpolated value of the magnitude or other scalar field at each incremental step. Although backwards compatibility is for the most part maintained, beginning with version 6.1.0, this resource supports the new 32-bit color model, as follows: If vcLevelColors is not set explicitly, its values are derived from the settings of vcLevelPalette and vcSpanLevelPalette, or, if vcLevelPalette is not set, wkColorMap and vcSpanLevelPalette. If vcSpanLevelPalette is True, the values are distributed evenly through the range of colors available from vcLevelPalette or wkColorMap. Otherwise, the values are sequential. If the color indexes are derived from vcLevelPalette the first color comes from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color comes from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. If some but not all of the available elements of vcLevelColors are explicitly set, the remaining elements will be determined as if vcSpanLevelPalette has the value False. For backwards compatibility, colors set based on wkColorMap remain indexed to the current color map associated with the workstation. Consequently, if the workstation color map is changed prior to drawing the plot, the color indexes will map into the new color map. In contrast, color indexes derived from the vcLevelPalette resource always refer to a specific color regardless of changes to wkColorMap. Default: <dynamic> 
vcLevelCount A read-only resource set to the actual number of levels chosen during the level selection process. Default: 16 
vcLevelPalette This resource of type NhlTColorDefinitionGenArray allows you to set a color palette from which the values assigned to vcLevelColors are chosen. You can set this resource to the string name of a predefined color map, an array of named colors, or an array of RGB or RGBA values. If you set vcLevelPalette using a predefined color map, it will have two fewer elements than if you set wkColorMap using the same color map. This is because the wkColorMap resource contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Use vcSpanLevelPalette to indicate whether to span the full color palette or to simply use sequentially increasing values. Default: None 
vcLevelSelectionMode This enumerated resource of type NhlTLevelSelectionMode provides four methods for selecting the levels used to color the vector arrows: AutomaticLevels     Ordinarily this mode determines vector levels by picking a spacing value from a set of relatively "round" numbers scaled by powers of 10 to the range of the data. This set of numbers is as follows: 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0. The number of levels chosen will be as close as possible to the value of vcMaxLevelCount without exceeding it. Once the spacing is chosen, the minimum vector level is set to the value of the least multiple of the spacing greater than the minimum data value. Likewise the maximum vector level becomes the greatest multiple of the spacing less than the maximum data value. Based on these values, VectorPlot sets the resources vcLevelSpacingF, vcMinLevelValF, and vcMaxLevelValF appropriately.     On the other hand, if you explicitly set the resource vcLevelSpacingF to a valid value greater than 0.0 and less than the range of the data, it will be used as the interval spacing. The minimum and maximum levels are calculated as before. If as a consequence, vcMaxLevelCount is less than the number of levels so specified, it will be set to the number of levels actually needed. However, if the choice of spacing causes the absolute maximum number of levels (currently 255) to be exceeded, VectorPlot will issue a warning message and recalculate the spacing as previously described.     In any case, VectorPlot sets the elements of the array resource vcLevels to the values of the vector levels chosen and the read-only resource vcLevelCount to the number of levels.  ManualLevels     ManualLevels mode bases the choice of vector levels on the values of the resources vcLevelSpacingF, vcMinLevelValF, and vcMaxLevelValF. Starting at vcMinLevelValF, vector levels are created at intervals spaced by the value of vcLevelSpacingF until vcMaxLevelValF is reached. The final vector level will always be vcMaxLevelValF. VectorPlot sets elements of the array resource vcLevels to the values of each vector level chosen and the read-only resource vcLevelCount to the number of levels. If the current value of vcMaxLevelCount is less than vcLevelCount, it is reset to the value of vcLevelCount. However, if the level count would exceed the absolute maximum number of levels, currently 255, VectorPlot issues a warning and chooses a new value of vcLevelSpacingF based on the value of vcMaxLevelCount.     If you choose ManualLevels selection mode when the VectorPlot object is created, and do not set vcMinLevelValF, VectorPlot will choose levels as if you had set AutomaticLevels mode. If you set vcMinLevelValF only, a default spacing is used, and the value of vcMaxLevelValF is determined as it would be for AutomaticLevels mode.  ExplicitLevels     This mode allows you to specify the value of each vector level by explicitly setting the contents of the vcLevels array. If you choose ExplicitLevels selection mode when creating a VectorPlot object, but do not specify the contents of the vcLevels array, VectorPlot will choose levels as if you had specified AutomaticLevels mode. Thereafter, when you set ExplicitLevels mode, VectorPlot uses the current contents of vcLevels, whether or not you set it explicitly.     If the number of elements in vcLevels exceeds the absolute maximum number of levels (currently 255), VectorPlot issues a warning and the mode defaults to AutomaticLevels. Note that VectorPlot always sorts the elements of vcLevels into a monotonically increasing sequence. After sorting, vcMinLevelValF is set equal to the value of first element of vcLevels, and vcMaxLevelValF is set to the value of the last element. vcLevelSpacingF is set to the average value of the spacing separating each level.  EqualSpacedLevels     For this mode, VectorPlot divides the range spanning the dataset minimum and maximum values into vcMaxLevelCount+1 equally spaced intervals. vcLevelSpacingF is set to the value of this interval. vcMinLevelValF is set to the value of the dataset minimum plus the value of vcLevelSpacingF. vcMaxLevelValF is set to the value of the dataset maximum minus the value of vcLevelSpacingF. This results in vcMaxLevelCount levels; therefore VectorPlot sets the read-only resource vcLevelCount equal to vcMaxLevelCount.  Default: AutomaticLevels 
vcLevelSpacingF When the vcLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels or when the vcLevelSelectionMode is AutomaticLevels, and vcLevelSpacingF is explicitly set, vcLevelSpacingF determines the spacing between vector intervals. Otherwise, the VectorPlot object sets the value of vcLevelSpacingF based on the vector levels actually chosen. When the vcLevelSelectionMode is ExplicitLevels, vcLevelSpacingF will be set to the arithmetic average of the spacing between levels. Default: 5.0 
vcLevels An array of floats containing values that determine the color of the vector arrows in the vector field plot. If vcScalarFieldData is valid and the resource vcUseScalarArray is set True, the level values are based on the scalar array data; otherwise the level values are based on the magnitudes of the vector elements in the vector field. If the vcLevelSelectionMode is ExplicitLevels, you may set these values yourself. Otherwise, the VectorPlot object sets the elements of this array. Default: <dynamic> 
vcLineArrowColor When vcMonoLineArrowColor is set True, this resource of type NhlTColorIndex sets a uniform color index for all lines used to draw vector arrows. If set to Transparent (-1), the line color index will be constrained to the value Foreground (1). This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to LineArrow or CurlyVector. Default: Foreground 
vcLineArrowHeadMaxSizeF Specifies a maximum length for the lines that form the point of the arrowhead of line-drawn vectors, as a fraction of the viewport width. Normally the arrowhead size is scaled proportionally to the length of the vector. This resource allows you to ensure that the arrowheads do not become excessively large for high magnitude vectors. If vcLineArrowHeadMinSizeF is set to the same value as vcLineArrowHeadMaxSizeF, all arrowheads in the vector plot will be drawn at the same size. Setting both resources to 0.0 will cause the arrows to be drawn without any heads at all. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to LineArrow or CurlyVector. Default: 0.05 (LineArrow), 0.012 (CurlyVector) 
vcLineArrowHeadMinSizeF Specifies a minimum length for the lines that form the point of the arrowhead of line-drawn vectors, as a fraction of the viewport width. Normally the arrowhead size is scaled proportionally to the length of the vector. This resource allows you to ensure that the arrowhead will remain recognizable even for very short vectors. If vcLineArrowHeadMinSizeF is set to the same value as vcLineArrowHeadMaxSizeF, all arrowheads in the vector plot will be drawn at the same size. Setting both resources to 0.0 will cause the arrows to be drawn without any heads at all. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to LineArrow or CurlyVector. Default: 0.005 
vcLineArrowThicknessF This resource sets the thickness of the line used to draw vector line arrows. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to LineArrow or CurlyVector. Default: 1.0 
vcMagnitudeFormat The vcMagnitudeFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for vector field values according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. This resource controls the formatting of any number representing VectorField data when used in a VectorPlot annotation. Default: "*+^sg" 
vcMagnitudeScaleFactorF vcMagnitudeScaleFactorF is a read-only resource that contains the current scale factor that applies to annotations with numbers representing magnitudes in the VectorField data object. Multiplying the numbers in the annotations by the value of vcMagnitudeScaleFactorF gives the actual magnitudes the numbers represent. VectorPlot calculates its value based on the maximum vector magnitude, the current mode of the enumerated resource, vcMagnitudeScalingMode, and perhaps the value of vcMagnitudeScaleValueF. Its value may also be influenced by the number of significant digits specified by the format specification resource, vcMagnitudeFormat. Default: 1.0 
vcMagnitudeScaleValueF The interpretation of vcMagnitudeScaleValueF depends on the value of the enumerated resource vcMagnitudeScalingMode. When vcMagnitudeScalingMode is set to ScaleFactor, values are divided by the value of vcMagnitudeScaleValueF to obtain the numbers appearing in VectorPlot object labels. If vcMagnitudeScalingMode is set to ConfineToRange, the vcMagnitudeScaleValueF represents an exclusive upper bound for the numbers used to represent the data values. For other values of vcMagnitudeScalingMode, the vcMagnitudeScaleValueF resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
vcMagnitudeScalingMode This resource of type NhlTScalingMode determines how numbers representing magnitudes in the vector field data are scaled when they appear in the annotations provided by VectorPlot. There are five choices: ScaleFactor     The VectorPlot object divides the magnitude by the value of vcMagnitudeScaleValueF to obtain the number that appears in the label.  ConfineToRange     The VectorPlot object uses vcMagnitudeScaleValueF as an exclusive upper bound. A scale factor is selected such that the scaled maximum magnitude will be less than vcMagnitudeScaleValueF, but greater than or equal to vcMagnitudeScaleValueF divided by 10.0. As an example, setting vcMagnitudeScaleValueF to 100.0 would result in the number used to represent the scaled maximum magnitude falling in the range 10.0 to 99.999....  TrimZeros     The VectorPlot object selects a scale factor such that the number representing the scaled maximum magnitude will have the fewest possible extra zeros. If the maximum magnitude were 245000, for instance, it would scale to 245. If it were 0.000245, it would scale to 0.245. (The zero conventionally placed before the decimal point of a number less than 1.0 is not considered.)  MaxSigDigitsLeft     The VectorPlot object selects a scale factor such that the number representing the scaled maximum magnitude will have its rightmost significant digit directly to the left of the decimal point. The number of significant digits is determined by the format string resource, vcMagnitudeFormat.  AllIntegers     The VectorPlot object selects a scale factor such that the numbers representing the vector levels (as determined by examination of the values of the vcLevels array) are reduced to integers.  In each case, the scale factor selected is placed into the read-only resource, vcMagnitudeScaleFactorF. Default: ScaleFactor 
vcMapDirection This resource controls whether the vector direction is mapped into the same coordinate space as the vector location, or whether it is rendered in a locally uniform cartesian coordinate space. This resource has an effect whenever a non-uniform transformation is in effect. These include most of the MapTransformation transformations and IrregularTransformation transformations. Also included are logarithmic transformations provided by the LogLinTransformation and even linear transformations when the X and Y unit sizes are different. Default: True 
vcMaxLevelCount When the vcLevelSelectionMode is AutomaticLevels and vcLevelSpacingF is not explicitly set, VectorPlot picks a number of levels less than or equal to the current value of vcMaxLevelCount. If the vcLevelSelectionMode is EqualSpacedLevels, VectorPlot picks exactly vcMaxLevelCount levels. If vcMaxLevelCount exceeds the absolute maximum level count allowed by VectorPlot (currently 255), a warning is issued and the value is reset to this maximum. If vcLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels or ExplicitLevels or AutomaticLevels with vcLevelSpacingF explicitly set, VectorPlot sets vcMaxLevelCount to the number of levels actually used if this number is greater than the current value of vcMaxLevelCount. Default: 16 
vcMaxLevelValF When the vcLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels, the value of vcMaxLevelValF, if set, determines the highest vector level. Otherwise, VectorPlot sets the vcMaxLevelValF to a value equal to highest vector level picked. Default: <dynamic> 
vcMaxMagnitudeF This resource specifies a maximum magnitude for elements of the vector field. Vectors with magnitudes greater than this value will not be rendered in the vector field plot. Default: 0.0 
vcMinAnnoAngleF NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Default: 0.0 
vcMinAnnoArrowAngleF This resource specifies the angle, in degrees, of the arrow used in the minimum vector annotation. Default: 0.0 
vcMinAnnoArrowEdgeColor If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set False, this resource specifies the HLU line color index used to render the arrow in the reference annotation. If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set True, and either vcUseScalarArray or vcMonoLineArrowColor is True, the line color index is determined from the value of vcLineArrowColor. If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set True otherwise, the line color index is determined based on the magnitude of the reference annotation vector and the vcLevelColors array resource. Default: Foreground 
vcMinAnnoArrowFillColor If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set False, this resource specifies the HLU fill color index used to render the arrow in the reference annotation. If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set True, and either vcUseScalarArray or vcMonoFillArrowFillColor is True, the fill color index is determined from the value of vcFillArrowFillColor. If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set True otherwise, the fill color index is determined based on the magnitude of the reference annotation vector and the vcLevelColors array resource. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to FillArrow. Default: Foreground 
vcMinAnnoArrowLineColor If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set False, this resource specifies the HLU line color index used to render the arrow in the reference annotation. If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set True, and either vcUseScalarArray or vcMonoLineArrowColor is True, the line color index is determined from the value of vcLineArrowColor. If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set True otherwise, the line color index is determined based on the magnitude of the reference annotation vector and the vcLevelColors array resource. Default: Foreground 
vcMinAnnoArrowMinOffsetF This resource specifies the minimum amount of space between the minimum vector annotation arrow and the text on either side in units of the minimum annotation font height. Default: 0.25 
vcMinAnnoArrowSpaceF This resource specifies the minimum amount of space reserved for the reference vector annotation arrow in units of the minimum annotation font height. More space may be used if the arrow extent (in units of the font height) plus twice the value of vcMinAnnoArrowMinOffsetF exceeds this value. Default: 2.0 
vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor If this resource is set True, VectorPlot will base the coloring of the minimum arrow on the colors used to draw the vector plot arrows as follows: if coloring by magnitude is in effect (vcUseScalarArray and, depending on the value of vcGlyphStyle, the appropriate "mono" color flag is set False), then the color will be that assigned to vectors representing the magnitude of the minimum annotation vector; otherwise, the color index will be determined from the current values assigned to vcLineArrowColor and/or vcFillArrowFillColor. If vcMinAnnoArrowUseVecColor is False, then vcMinAnnoArrowLineColor and vcMinAnnoArrowFillColor control the color of the minimum annotation arrow. Default: True 
vcMinAnnoBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding the vector minimum annotation. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set vcMinAnnoBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). Default: Background 
vcMinAnnoConstantSpacingF Normally when vcMinAnnoFontQuality is set to High, VectorPlot draws the minimum vector annotation text using proportional spacing. Setting the vcMinAnnoConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of vcMinAnnoConstantSpacingF. When vcMinAnnoConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when vcMinAnnoFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
vcMinAnnoExplicitMagnitudeF By default, the arrow in the minimum vector annotation is drawn at the size of the current VectorPlot minimum magnitude. However, if you set this resource to a value greater than its default value of 0.0, the size of arrow will reflect the vector magnitude represented by this value. Default: 0.0 
vcMinAnnoFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the vector minimum annotation. Default: "pwritx" 
vcMinAnnoFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the minimum vector annotation characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in characters that appear thinner. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters appear wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
vcMinAnnoFontColor This resource specifies the HLU color index used to render vector minimum annotation text. Default: Foreground 
vcMinAnnoFontHeightF This resource controls the height, in NDC units, of characters used in the text of the minimum vector annotation. The character width scales proportionally, unless you also modify the aspect ratio using the vcMinAnnoFontAspectF resource. The minimum annotation font height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set vcMinAnnoFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> 
vcMinAnnoFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the VectorPlot vector minimum annotation. Default: High 
vcMinAnnoFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw vector minimum annotation text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the vcMinAnnoFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
vcMinAnnoFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character for the minimum vector annotation strings. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
vcMinAnnoJust This resource of type NhlTJustification, after constraint to an appropriate value based on vcMinAnnoSide, sets the justification of the vector minimum annotation with respect to its base location.

vcMinAnnoOn If this boolean resource is set False, VectorPlot will not draw the minimum vector annotation. Default: True 
vcMinAnnoOrientation NOT YET IMPLEMENTED This resource of type NhlTOrientation specifies whether the elements of the minimum vector annotation (two strings with an arrow representing a vector magnitude in between) are stacked vertically or placed side by side horizontally. Default: Vertical 
vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the vector minimum annotation orthogonal to the current vcMinAnnoSide and directed away from the center of the viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the vector minimum annotation consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.02 
vcMinAnnoParallelPosF vcMinAnnoParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the vector minimum annotation parallel to the current vcMinAnnoSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the vector minimum annotation consistent with other annotations. Default: 1.0 
vcMinAnnoPerimColor This resource sets the HLU color index used to draw the perimeter of the vector minimum annotation. Default: Foreground 
vcMinAnnoPerimOn vcMinAnnoPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether VectorPlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding the minimum vector annotation. If set False, no outline will be drawn. Default: True 
vcMinAnnoPerimSpaceF vcMinAnnoPerimSpaceF determines the spacing, or margin, between the text of the minimum vector annotation and its edge as a fraction of current minimum annotation font height. Default: 0.33 
vcMinAnnoPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the vector minimum annotation. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
vcMinAnnoSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the vector minimum annotation in relation to the sides of the plot object. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the vector minimum annotation consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources vcMinAnnoParallelPosF and vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of vcMinAnnoJust appropriately. There are four settings, which behave as follows, unless vcMinAnnoZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     The PlotManager locates the vector minimum annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcMinAnnoParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. vcMinAnnoJust is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.  Bottom     The PlotManager locates the vector minimum annotation relative to a line paralleling the bottom viewport boundary. vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcMinAnnoParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. vcMinAnnoJust is constrained to TopRight, TopCenter, or TopLeft.  Right     The PlotManager locates the vector minimum annotation relative to a line paralleling the right viewport boundary. vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcMinAnnoParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. vcMinAnnoJust is constrained to TopLeft, CenterLeft, or BottomLeft.  Left     The PlotManager locates the vector minimum annotation relative to a line paralleling the left viewport boundary. vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcMinAnnoParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. vcMinAnnoJust is constrained to TopRight, CenterRight, or BottomRight.  If vcMinAnnoZone is set to 0, The PlotManager locates the vector minimum annotation relative to the viewport center. If vcMinAnnoZone is 1, the direction of the vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the vcMinAnnoZone is either 0 or 1, vcMinAnnoJust is not constrained, and vcMinAnnoOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
vcMinAnnoString1 Specifies the string to use above or to the left (depending on the current value of vcMinAnnoOrientation) of the arrow in the minimum vector annotation. The string may contain function codes and/or substitution substrings. vcMagnitudeFormat determines the format of all numbers related to the vector field, and all numbers, except for the number generated from the substitution substring $MSF$, are scaled by the value of vcMagnitudeScaleFactorF. vcScalarValueFormat determines the format of all numbers related to the scalar field, and all numbers, except for the number generated from the substitution substring $SSF$, are scaled by the value of vcScalarValueScaleFactorF. Default: "$VMG$" 
vcMinAnnoString1On If this boolean resource is set False, VectorPlot will not display a string above or to the left (depending on the current value of vcMinAnnoOrientation) of the minimum annotation arrow. Otherwise, the string will be displayed. Default: True 
vcMinAnnoString2 Specifies the string to use above or to the left (depending on the current value of vcMinAnnoOrientation) of the arrow in the minimum vector annotation. The string may contain function codes and/or substitution substrings. vcMagnitudeFormat determines the format of all numbers related to the vector field, and all numbers, except for the number generated from the substitution substring $MSF$, are scaled by the value of vcMagnitudeScaleFactorF. vcScalarValueFormat determines the format of all numbers related to the scalar field, and all numbers, except for the number generated from the substitution substring $SSF$, are scaled by the value of vcScalarValueScaleFactorF. Default: "Minimum Vector" 
vcMinAnnoString2On If this boolean resource is set False, VectorPlot will not display a string below or to the right (depending on the current value of vcMinAnnoOrientation) of the minimum annotation arrow. Otherwise, the string will be displayed. Default: True 
vcMinAnnoTextDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text in the minimum vector annotation. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  Default: Across 
vcMinAnnoZone VectorPlot implements the vector minimum annotation as an embedded annotation. vcMinAnnoZone specifies the PlotManager zone assigned to the vector minimum annotation. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the minimum annotation consistent with other annotations. If vcMinAnnoZone is set to 0, the positional origin is the center of the plot viewport; otherwise it is on or outside one of the sides of the viewport. Default: 3 
vcMinDistanceF This resource specifies a minimum distance in NDC space that is to separate the data locations of neighboring vectors. Vectors are elimininated from the plot until there are no vectors closer than the specified distance. Note that if the realized length of a vector glyph is long enough, it is still possible that it may overlap neighboring glyphs. However, the grid point locations are guaranteed to be no closer than the distance specified. When this resource has its default value, 0.0, the thinning algorithm is not applied. Default: 0.0 
vcMinFracLengthF If vcGlyphStyle is not set to WindBarb, this resource specifies, as a fraction of the reference length (vcRefLengthF), the length used to render the minimum magnitude vector. If vcMinMagnitudeF is greater than 0.0, its value is used as the minimum magnitude; otherwise the magnitude of the smallest vector appearing in the plot is used as the minimum magnitude. The lengths of the remaining vectors are determined by scaling proportionally between this length and the reference length. Setting vcMinFracLengthF to the value 1.0 causes all vectors to be drawn with the same length. If vcMinFracLengthF has its default value, 0.0, the vector length is strictly proportional to its magnitude. If vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb, the value of vcMinFracLengthF is effectively forced to the value 1.0, and its set value is ignored. Default: 0.0 
vcMinLevelValF When the vcLevelSelectionMode is ManualLevels, the value of vcMinLevelValF, if set, determines the lowest vector level. Otherwise, VectorPlot sets the vcMinLevelValF to a value equal to lowest vector level picked. Default: <dynamic> 
vcMinMagnitudeF This resource specifies a minimum magnitude for elements of the vector field. Vectors with magnitudes less than this value will not be rendered in the vector field plot. Default: 0.0 
vcMonoFillArrowEdgeColor When set True, the edge color for all filled vector arrows is set to a single HLU color index, as specified by the value of the scalar resource vcFillArrowEdgeColor.

This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to LineArrow or CurlyVector. Default: True 
vcMonoWindBarbColor When this resource is set True, wind barb glyphs are colored using a single HLU color index, as specified by the value of the scalar resource vcWindBarbColor.

This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: True 
vcNoDataLabelOn This boolean resource, when set True, causes a label to appear when a vectorplot is drawn without any data having been provided. Except for the label string, all attributes of this label, including its position, are set using resources belonging to the constant field label. When set False, no such label appears. Default: True 
vcNoDataLabelString This resource contains the string that appears in the 'No Data' label if you draw a VectorPlot object without providing any data. No substitution substrings are allowed in this label, since all the substitutions depend on data being available. Except for the boolean switch that turns it on and off, all attributes of this label, including its position, are set using resources belonging to the constant field label. Default: "NO VECTOR DATA" 
vcPositionMode This resource of type NhlTVectorPositionMode specifies how the vector arrow is positioned in the vector field plot relative to the actual data location. There are three possibilites: ArrowHead     The head of the arrow is placed at the data location.  ArrowCenter     The center of the arrow is placed at the data location.

Default: Foreground 
vcRefAnnoArrowFillColor If vcRefAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set False, this resource specifies the HLU fill color index used to render the arrow in the reference annotation. If vcRefAnnoArrowUseVecColor is set True, and either vcUseScalarArray or vcMonoFillArrowFillColor is True, the fill color index is determined from the value of vcFillArrowFillColor.

Setting the vcRefAnnoConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of vcRefAnnoConstantSpacingF. When vcRefAnnoConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when vcRefAnnoFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
vcRefAnnoExplicitMagnitudeF By default, the arrow in the reference vector annotation is drawn at the size of the current VectorPlot reference magnitude. However, if you set this resource to a value greater than its default value of 0.0, the size of the arrow will reflect the vector magnitude represented by this value. Default: 0.0 
vcRefAnnoFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the vector reference annotation. Default: "pwritx" 
vcRefAnnoFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the reference vector annotation characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in characters that appear thinner.

vcRefAnnoSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the vector reference annotation in relation to the sides of the plot object. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the vector reference annotation consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources vcRefAnnoParallelPosF and vcRefAnnoOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of vcRefAnnoJust appropriately. There are four settings, which behave as follows, unless vcRefAnnoZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     The PlotManager locates the vector reference annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. vcRefAnnoOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcRefAnnoParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. vcRefAnnoJust is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.

If vcRefAnnoZone is set to 0, the positional origin is the center of the plot viewport; otherwise it is on or outside one of the sides of the viewport. Default: 3 
vcRefLengthF If vcGlyphStyle is set to LineArrow or FillArrow, this resource specifies, in units of NDC, the length used to render vectors with a magnitude equal to the reference magnitude, as specified by vcRefMagnitudeF. If vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb, it specifies the length of the wind barb shaft plus the projected length of a full tick along the shaft axis. If vcGlyphStyle is set to CurlyVector it specifies the path length of the curve used to render render vectors with a magnitude equal to the reference magnitude. The path length is calculated as the sum of the individual steps used to generate the curve. If vcRefLengthF is not specified, its value is dynamically calculated based on the number of elements in the vector field and the size of the VectorPlot viewport. Default: <dynamic> 
vcRefMagnitudeF This resource specifies the magnitude used as the reference magnitude used for the vector field plot. Vectors equal in magnitude to the reference magnitude will be rendered at the length specified by the resource vcRefLengthF. If vcRefMagnitudeF has its default value, 0.0, the maximum magnitude in the vector field will be used as the reference magnitude. Default: 0.0 
vcScalarFieldData Specifies the id of a ScalarField data object. If this resource is set with a valid ScalarField object and the resource vcUseScalarArray is set True, VectorPlot will use the scalar array data for coloring the arrows used to render the vector field plot. In order for VectorPlot to consider the ScalarField object valid, it must find that it has the same number of elements along each dimension as are found in the VectorField object. Note that currently the number of elements is checked only after strides and subsetting are applied. The data coordinate extents set for the ScalarField object are ignored. For now, the data coordinate extents of the processed ScalarField data are assumed to coincide with the data coordinate extents of the VectorField data. Default: none 
vcScalarMissingValColor When vcUseScalarArray is True, this resource sets the HLU index of the fill or line color used to draw vectors whose associated scalar value is missing. If vcScalarMissingValColor has the value Transparent (-1), the vector will not be drawn at all. Default: Foreground 
vcScalarValueFormat The vcScalarValueFormat resource is a string that specifies the printing format for vector field values according to the HLU Floating Point Format Specification scheme. This resource controls the formatting of any number representing VectorField data when used in a VectorPlot annotation. Default: "*+^sg" 
vcScalarValueScaleFactorF vcScalarValueScaleFactorF is a read-only resource that contains the current scale factor that applies to annotations with numbers representing values from the associated ScalarField object. Multiplying the numbers in the annotations by the value of vcScalarValueScaleFactorF gives the actual scalar values the numbers represent. VectorPlot calculates its value based on the maximum absolute value in the scalar field data, the current mode of the enumerated resource, vcScalarValueScalingMode, and perhaps the value of vcScalarValueScaleValueF. Its value may also be influenced by the number of significant digits specified by the format specification resource, vcScalarValueFormat. Default: 1.0 
vcScalarValueScaleValueF The interpretation of vcScalarValueScaleValueF depends on the value of the enumerated resource vcScalarValueScalingMode. When vcScalarValueScalingMode is set to ScaleFactor, values are divided by the value of vcScalarValueScaleValueF to obtain the numbers appearing in VectorPlot object labels. If vcScalarValueScalingMode is set to ConfineToRange, the vcScalarValueScaleValueF represents an exclusive upper bound for the numbers used to represent the data values. For other values of vcScalarValueScalingMode, the vcScalarValueScaleValueF resource is ignored. Default: 1.0 
vcScalarValueScalingMode This resource of type NhlTScalingMode determines how to scale numbers related to the scalar field data used to color the vectors when these numbers appear in the annotations provided by VectorPlot. There are five choices: ScaleFactor     The VectorPlot object divides the scalar value by the value of vcScalarValueScaleValueF to obtain the number that appears in the label.  ConfineToRange     The VectorPlot object uses vcScalarValueScaleValueF as an exclusive upper bound. A scale factor is selected such that the scaled value representing the scalar maximum absolute value will be less than vcScalarValueScaleValueF, but greater than or equal to vcScalarValueScaleValueF divided by 10.0. As an example, setting vcScalarValueScaleValueF to 100.0 would result in the number used to represent the maximum absolute value falling in the range 10.0 to 99.999....  TrimZeros     The VectorPlot object selects a scale factor such that the number representing the value with the maximum absolute value will have the fewest possible extra zeros. If the maximum absolute value were 245000, for instance, it would scale to 245. If it were 0.000245, it would scale to 0.245. (The zero conventionally placed before the decimal point of a number less than 1.0 is not considered.)  MaxSigDigitsLeft     The VectorPlot object selects a scale factor such that the number representing the value with the maximum absolute value will have its rightmost significant digit directly to the left of the decimal point. The number of significant digits is determined by the format string resource, vcScalarValueFormat.  AllIntegers     The VectorPlot object selects a scale factor such that the numbers representing vector levels (as determined by examination of the values of the vcLevels array) are reduced to integers.  In each case, the scale factor selected is placed into the read-only resource, vcScalarValueScaleFactorF. Default: ScaleFactor 
vcSpanLevelPalette If set to True, and if vcLevelColors is not set using explicit values, then VectorPlot automatically spans the vcLevelPalette resource to determine color index values for vcLevelColors. If vcLevelPalette is not set then the wkColorMap resource is spanned instead. If set to False, then VectorPlot uses consecutively ascending values to populate vcLevelColors. If the colors are derived from vcLevelPalette the first color will be determined from element 0, whereas if they are derived from wkColorMap, the first color will come from element 2. This is because wkColorMap contains special elements (0 and 1) for the Background and Foreground colors, whereas the palette-type resources do not. Default: True 
vcUseRefAnnoRes If this boolean resource is True, the values for many resources belonging to the reference vector annotation are copied to the minimum vector annotation and the zero field annotation, allowing you to ensure consistency in the appearance of each of these annotations without the need to set each resource individually. The following text attribute resource values are copied to the corresponding resources of both the minimum vector annotation and the zero field annotation:     vcRefAnnoFontHeightF     vcRefAnnoTextDirection     vcRefAnnoFont     vcRefAnnoFontColor     vcRefAnnoFontAspectF     vcRefAnnoFontThicknessF     vcRefAnnoFontQuality     vcRefAnnoConstantSpacingF     vcRefAnnoFuncCode     vcRefAnnoBackgroundColor     vcRefAnnoPerimOn     vcRefAnnoPerimSpaceF     vcRefAnnoPerimColor     vcRefAnnoPerimThicknessF  The following resources are copied only to the corresponding minimum vector annotation resource:     vcRefAnnoArrowSpaceF     vcRefAnnoArrowMinOffsetF     vcRefAnnoArrowLineColor     vcRefAnnoArrowFillColor     vcRefAnnoArrowEdgeColor     vcRefAnnoArrowUseVecColor  Note that the zonal location resources, angle, the string contents, the "on" switches, and the explicit magnitude resources are not copied. Default: False 
vcUseScalarArray If this boolean resource is set True, the resource vcScalarFieldData is set with a valid ScalarField object, and the appropriate VectorPlot resources are set to enable multi-colored vector glyphs, then the ScalarField data are used to select the level (and hence the color index) assigned to each glyph. Otherwise, when multi-colored vector glyphs are enabled, vector coloring will be based on the magnitude of the vectors. Default: False 
vcVectorDrawOrder This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when the vector arrows are drawn relative to the drawing of other elements of a composite plot. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw vector arrows before the standard draw phase; the arrows will be overlaid by any subsequently drawn elements.  Draw     Draw vector arrows during the standard draw phase; the arrows will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw phase, but will underlie elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw vector arrows after the standard draw; the arrows will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw and draw phases.  Default: Draw 
vcVectorFieldData Specifies the id of a VectorField data object. There is no default for this resource; it is the only resource that must be set in order for the VectorPlot object to draw a plot. You may create a VectorPlot object without setting the vcVectorFieldData, and auxiliary annotations such as tick marks and titles may appear as the result of a draw, but the VectorPlot itself will not show up. The VectorField object can provide either regularly spaced or irregular rectangular gridded data to the VectorPlot object, and it provides a number of resources for controlling the ingestion of the raw data. Default: none 
vcWindBarbCalmCircleSizeF This resource sets the diameter of the circle used to represent small vector magnitudes as a fraction of the overall wind barb length. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: 0.25 
vcWindBarbColor When vcMonoWindBarbColor is set True, this resource sets a uniform color index for all polygon and polyline elements used to draw wind barb glyphs. If set to Transparent (-1), the line color index will be constrained to the value Foreground (1). This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: Foreground 
vcWindBarbLineThicknessF This resource sets the thickness of the polyline elements used to draw wind barb glyphs. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: 1.0 
vcWindBarbScaleFactorF This resource sets the factor by which the vector magnitudes as calculated by the wind barb drawing routines are to be scaled. It can be used to convert vector data given in other units into the conventional units used with wind barbs, which is knots. Note that this scale factor resource is entirely independent of the vcMagnitudeScaleFactorF and vcMagnitudeScaleValueF resources which influence numerical strings in annotations associated with VectorPlot. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: 1.0 
vcWindBarbTickAngleF This resource set the angle of the wind barb ticks measured clockwise from the vector direction. It also sets the angle between the hypotenuse of the triangle defining the pennant polygon and the vector direction. You can render southern hemisphere wind barbs, which by convention have their ticks and pennants on the other side of the shaft, by setting vcWindBarbTickAngleF to a negative value. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: 62.0 
vcWindBarbTickLengthF This resource sets the length of a wind barb tick as a fraction of the overall length of a wind barb. The wind barb length is defined as the length of the wind barb shaft plus the projection of a full wind barb tick along the axis of the shaft. Therefore, increasing this value, for a given vector reference length, has the effect of reducing the length of the shaft itself somewhat. You may need to increase vcRefLengthF to compensate. This resource also sets the hypotenuse length of the triangle defining the pennant polygon. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: 0.3 
vcWindBarbTickSpacingF This resource sets the spacing of the wind barb ticks along the wind barb shaft as a fraction of the overall wind barb length. Half this distance is used as the spacing between adjacent wind barb pennants. Note that VectorPlot does nothing to prevent ticks or pennants from continuing off the end of the shaft if high magnitude flow fields are rendered. This resource has an effect only when vcGlyphStyle is set to WindBarb. Default: 0.125 
vcZeroFLabelAngleF This resource specifies the angle, in degrees, of the zero field label text and its surrounding box. Default: 0.0 
vcZeroFLabelBackgroundColor This resource sets the background color used to fill the box surrounding the zero field label. If you do not want the box to be filled at all, set vcZeroFLabelBackgroundColor to Transparent (-1). Default: Background 
vcZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when vcZeroFLabelFontQuality is set to High, the VectorPlot object writes zero field label text with proportional spacing. Setting the vcZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of vcZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF. When vcZeroFLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when vcZeroFLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Default: 0.0 
vcZeroFLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render the zero field label. Default: 0 
vcZeroFLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the zero field label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in characters that appear thinner. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters appear wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Default: 1.3125 
vcZeroFLabelFontColor This resource specifies the HLU color index used to render zero field label text. Default: True 
vcZeroFLabelFontHeightF This resource controls the height, in NDC units, of characters used in the text of the zero field label. The character width scales proportionally, unless you also modify the aspect ratio using the vcZeroFLabelFontAspectF resource. The zero label text height scales with changes to the viewport width, unless you explicitly set vcZeroFLabelFontHeightF during the same call. Default: <dynamic> 
vcZeroFLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw the VectorPlot zero field label. Default: High 
vcZeroFLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw zero field label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the vcZeroFLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Default: 1.0 
vcZeroFLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the zero field label string. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~ 
vcZeroFLabelJust This resource of type NhlTJustification, after constraint to an appropriate value based on vcZeroFLabelSide, sets the justification of the zero field label annotation with respect to its base location. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Default: CenterCenter 
vcZeroFLabelOn The VectorPlot object draws a zero field label annotation only when vcZeroFLabelOn is set True and the ScalarField data are determined to consist entirely of zero magnitude vectors within the limits of the available precision. Default: True 
vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF sets the coordinate of the base location of the zero field label annotation orthogonal to the current vcZeroFLabelSide and directed away from the center of the viewport. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
vcZeroFLabelParallelPosF vcZeroFLabelParallelPosF specifies the coordinate of the base location of the zero field label annotation parallel to the current vcZeroFLabelSide and directed toward increasing NDC values. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Default: 0.0 
vcZeroFLabelPerimColor This resource sets the HLU color index used to draw the perimeter of the zero field label box. Default: Foreground 
vcZeroFLabelPerimOn vcZeroFLabelPerimOn is a boolean resource that determines whether VectorPlot will draw an outline around the perimeter of the box surrounding vector zero field label. If set False, no outline will be drawn. Default: True 
vcZeroFLabelPerimSpaceF vcZeroFLabelPerimSpaceF determines the spacing, or margin, between the text of the zero field label and the edge of the zero field label box as a fraction of the current label text height. Default: 0.33 
vcZeroFLabelPerimThicknessF This resource determines the thickness of the perimeter line around the zero field label box. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. Default: 1.0 
vcZeroFLabelSide This resource of type NhlTPosition determines where to place the zero field annotation in relation to the sides of the plot object. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. Its value determines a coordinate system origin and the direction of the positional resources vcZeroFLabelParallelPosF and vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF. It also constrains the value of the vcZeroFLabelJust appropriately. There are four settings, which behave as follows, unless vcZeroFLabelZone is set to one of the special zones (0 or 1): Top     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the top viewport boundary. vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. vcZeroFLabelJust is constrained to BottomRight, BottomCenter, or BottomLeft.  Bottom     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the bottom viewport boundary. vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC Y-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values. vcZeroFLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, TopCenter, or TopLeft.  Right     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the right viewport boundary. vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. vcZeroFLabelJust is constrained to TopLeft, CenterLeft, or BottomLeft.  Left     The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to a line paralleling the left viewport boundary. vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF increases in the direction of decreasing NDC X-Axis values and is constrained to positive values. vcZeroFLabelParallelPosF increases in the direction of increasing NDC Y-Axis values. vcZeroFLabelJust is constrained to TopRight, CenterRight, or BottomRight.  If vcZeroFLabelZone is set to 0, The PlotManager locates the zero field label annotation relative to the viewport center. If vcZeroFLabelZone is 1, the direction of the vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF is opposite to the specification given above. Also if the vcZeroFLabelZone is either 0 or 1, vcZeroFLabelJust is not constrained, and vcZeroFLabelOrthogonalPosF may take on negative values. Default: Bottom 
vcZeroFLabelString Specifies the string to use when drawing a zero field label. The string may contain function codes. Default: "ZERO FIELD" 
vcZeroFLabelTextDirection This resource of type NhlTTextDirection specifies the direction of the text in the zero field label. There are two choices: Down     Each character is placed below the previous character in the text string.  Across     Each character is placed to the right of the previous character in the text string.  These descriptions apply before rotation due to vcZeroFLabelAngleF. Default: Across 
vcZeroFLabelZone VectorPlot implements the zero field label as an embedded annotation. vcZeroFLabelZone specifies the PlotManager zone assigned to the zero field annotation. The PlotManager Location Control Model requires this resource to allow control of the zero field label consistent with other annotations. If vcZeroFLabelZone is set to 0, the positional origin is the center of the plot viewport; otherwise it is on or outside one of the sides of the viewport. If you create a VectorPlot object without an active PlotManager, by setting tfPlotManagerOn False, then VectorPlot manages the zero field annotation by itself. In this case, the vcZeroFLabelZone resource is not as meaningful. Default: 0 
vfCopyData The boolean resource vfCopyData allows you to control whether the VectorField object always copies the elements of the vfDataArray into a private memory area. If you set vfCopyData False, VectorField will not copy the vfXArray or the vfYArray data and will try to avoid making a copy of the vfDataArray data. You are then responsible for ensuring that the data memory locations for these arrays are preserved intact for the lifetime of the VectorField. In return, you may save dynamic memory space. Note that a number of circumstances require VectorField to copy the data regardless. These include supplying data of any type other than NhlTFloat, requesting that the data dimensions be exchanged, or setting a stride value greater than 1 in either the X or the Y dimension. Also, if you specify a data array subset and one or both of the coordinate array resources (vfXArray and/or vfYArray) is non-NULL, copies are made of the subsetted part of the coordinate array. Default: True 
vfDataArray This resource specifies a 3-dimensional array containing the data comprising a vector field. You must specify either vfDataArray or the two resources vfUDataArray and vfVDataArray in order to create a VectorField object. The slowest varying dimension (first dimension in C, third dimension in Fortran) must contain two elements, representing the two components of the field. The first element represents the U data and the second the V data (before the effect of vfExchangeUVData is taken into account). The fastest varying dimension represents the X Axis of the data coordinate system; vfXC... VectorField resources always relate to this dimension. The middle dimension represents the data coordinate Y Axis; vfYC... resources always relate to this dimension. Although the VectorField object always converts the data into type NhlTFloat before passing them along to recipient objects, it accepts data arrays containing data of any of the following types:     NhlTByte     NhlTCharacter     NhlTShort     NhlTInteger     NhlTLong     NhlTFloat     NhlTDouble  Default: NULL 
vfExchangeDimensions When this boolean resource is set True, VectorField exchanges the X and Y dimensions of the data before passing them to the recipient object. Resouces associated with the X-Axis are applied to the Y-Axis of the output data and vice-versa. This will have the effect of turning the plot on its side when rendered by a plot object. Note that since the U and V components implicitly exist in the coordinate system that is exchanged, these arrays must be exchanged at the same time in order maintain an equivalent relationship between the elements of the field. You can do this by inverting the value of the resource vfExchangeUVData. Whenever vfExchangeDimensions is True, VectorField must copy the data, regardless of the setting of the vfCopyData resource. Default: False 
vfExchangeUVData When this boolean resource is set True, VectorField exchanges the roles of the U and V arrays. If you supply the data using the single array resource vfDataArray, the two elements of the slowest varying dimension are traded. If vfExchangeDimensions is set True, you must invert the current value of vfExchangeUVData in order to preserve the current relationship of the elements of the vector field. If vfPolarData is set True, then this resource controls which array is used for the magnitude and which for the angular direction. Default: False 
vfMagMaxV By default the VectorField object sets vfMagMaxV to the largest vector magnitude computed from the individual vector components in the data arrays. However, if you set the value of this resource, VectorField assumes that the set value is, in fact, the maximum magnitude. You may set vfMagMaxV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
vfMagMinV By default the VectorField object sets vfMagMinV to the smallest vector magnitude computed from the individual vector components in the data arrays. However, if you set the value of this resource, VectorField assumes that the set value is, in fact, the minimum magnitude. You may set vfMagMinV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
vfMissingUValueV If vfSingleMissingValue is False and you set vfMissingUValueV to a non-NULL value, VectorField treats occurrences of its value in the U data array as representing an undefined data point. If left unset, VectorField assumes that all values in the U data array are valid. If vfSingleMissingValue is True and you set vfMissingUValueV to a non-NULL value, VectorField treats occurrences of its value in either the U or V data arrays as representing an undefined data point. If vfMissingUValueV is not set, but vfMissingVValueV is set, then occurrences of the value of vfMissingVValueV in either array causes the data point to be treated as undefined. If neither vfMissingUValueV nor vfMissingVValueV is set, then VectorField assumes that all values in the U data array are valid. You may set vfMissingVValueV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: NULL 
vfMissingVValueV If vfSingleMissingValue is False and you set vfMissingVValueV to a non-NULL value, VectorField treats occurrences of its value in the V data array as representing an undefined value. If left unset, VectorField assumes that all values in the V data array are valid. If vfSingleMissingValue is True and you set vfMissingVValueV to a non-NULL value, its value is ignored unless vfMissingUValueV is not set. If vfMissingUValueV is not set, VectorField treats occurrences of the value of vfMissingVValueV in either the U or V data arrays as representing an undefined data point. If neither vfMissingUValueV nor vfMissingVValueV is set, then VectorField assumes that all values in the U data array are valid. You may set vfMissingVValueV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: NULL 
vfPolarData If this resource is set True, the arrays passed into VectorField are assumed to represent the vector field in terms of magnitude and angular direction rather than by orthogonal vector components. By default the U array is interpreted as the magnitude and the V array as direction. However, if the resource vfExchangeUVData is set True, the V array will be assumed to contain the magnitude and the U array the direction. Default: False 
vfSingleMissingValue When this boolean resource is set True, VectorField assumes that any missing values in both the U and V arrays are represented by the same sentinel value. In this case, you need set only one of the resources vfMissingUValueV and vfMissingVValueV to indicate the sentinel missing value. If both are set, then the value given by vfMissingVValueV is ignored. When vfSingleMissingValue is set False, then the U and V array are examined separately for their individual missing values, as specified by the resources vfMissingUValueV and vfMissingVValueV. Default: False 
vfUDataArray If vfDataArray is not set, then this resource and vfVDataArray must both be specified in order to create a VectorField object. Together, these resources specify the data defining a vector field using two arrays specifying the vector components. The fastest varying dimension (second dimension in C, first dimension in Fortran) represents the X Axis of the data coordinate system; vfXC... VectorField resources always relate to this dimension. The other dimension represents the data coordinate Y Axis; vfYC... resources always relate to this dimension. You may set vfUDataArray using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: NULL 
vfUMaxV By default the VectorField object sets vfUMaxV to the largest value in the U data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, VectorField does not process the array to find the maximum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the maximum value. You may set vfUMaxV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
vfUMinV By default the VectorField object sets vfUMinV to the smallest value in the U data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, VectorField does not process the array to find the minimum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the minimum value. You may set vfUMaxV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
vfVDataArray If vfDataArray is not set, then this resource and vfUDataArray must both be specified in order to create a VectorField object. Together, these resources specify the data defining a vector field using two arrays specifying the vector components. The fastest varying dimension (second dimension in C, first dimension in Fortran) represents the X Axis of the data coordinate system; vfXC... VectorField resources always relate to this dimension. The other dimension represents the data coordinate Y Axis; vfYC... resources always relate to this dimension. You may set vfVDataArray using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: NULL 
vfVMaxV By default the VectorField object sets vfVMaxV to the largest value in the V data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, VectorField does not process the array to find the maximum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the maximum value. You may set vfVMaxV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
vfVMinV By default the VectorField object sets vfVMinV to the smallest value in the V data array. However, if you set the value of this resource, VectorField does not process the array to find the minimum value. Instead it assumes that the set value is, in fact, the minimum value. You may set vfVMaxV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXArray If vfXArray is NULL, the coordinates of the X (fastest-varying) axis of the data grid are assumed to be regularly spaced, and the endpoints are determined by the values of vfXCStartV and vfXCEndV. If vfXArray is set using a 1D array, its values represent sequential coordinate locations along the X-Axis (the fastest-varying dimension) of the data grid. The array must contain the same number of elements as this data array dimension. VectorField requires the coordinate array values to increase or decrease monotonically. If the coordinate array input does not have the right number of elements or is non-monotonic, VectorField issues a warning and restores vfXArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. If the input array is valid, VectorField replaces the current value of vfXCStartV with the value of the first element of vfXArray, and the current value of vfXCEndV with the value of the last element. If vfXArray is set using a 2D array, it must have the same dimension sizes as vfYArray and the two fastest varying dimensions of the data grid. Each element specifies the location along the X-Axis of a single data grid cell center. For 2D coordinates, there is no requirement that the coordinates be monotonic. However, if the coordinates provided are not well-ordered as expected by the 2D-coordinate tranvformation routines, errors will occur when the Draw method is called. If the array does not contain valid dimension sizes, VectorField issues a warning restores vfXArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. You can specify vfXArray using a one or two dimensional array of any of the types allowed for vfDataArray. V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
vfXCActualEndF When an ending location for a subset of the data is specified using vfXCEndSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. VectorField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. In this case, the read-only resource vfXCActualEndF is set to the value of the actual ending location of the data subset along the X Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, vfXCActualEndF has the same value as vfXCEndSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXCActualStartF When a starting location for a subset of the data is specified using vfXCStartSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. In this case, VectorField selects a beginning index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. The read-only resource vfXCActualStartF is set to the value of the actual starting location of the data subset along the X Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, vfXCActualStartF has the same value as vfXCStartSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXCEndIndex This resource specifies the larger of two indexes along the X-Axis data dimension. Valid values range from one greater than the value of vfXCStartIndex to one less than the size of the dimension. It is one of four resources used to specify a rectangular subset of the data using array indexes. This is the only form of subsetting VectorField supports when vfXArray and vfYArray are set using 2D coordinate arrays, Unless vfXArray is set with a 2D array, explicitly setting vfXCEndSubsetV overrides any value set for vfXCEndIndex and causes it to be set to the smallest array index value such that the requested data coordinate location is included within the subset. Otherwise, if you set vfXCEndIndex, vfXCEndSubsetV will be set based on its value. vfXCEndIndex retains its value when the data array changes, unless the X-Axis dimension size also changes. In this case, assuming neither vfXCEndSubsetV nor vfXCEndIndex is explicitly set at the same time, vfXCEndIndex is set to the size of the X-Axis dimension minus one. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXCEndSubsetV vfXCEndSubsetV specifies the ending location along the X Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data. It should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of vfXCStartV and vfXCEndV. If it is outside the coordinate extent, VectorField issues a warning and sets it to the value of vfXCEndV. If the values of vfXCStartSubsetV and vfXCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by vfXCStartV and vfXCEndV, VectorField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for vfXCEndSubsetV:     at initialization or when the X-Axis dimension size changes, if vfXCEndIndex is not set, vfXCEndSubsetV takes the value of vfXCEndV;     else if vfXCEndIndex is set, or there is a change to vfXCStartV, vfXCEndV, or vfXArray, vfXCEndSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of vfXCEndIndex;     else vfXCEndSubsetV retains its current value.  Since the data grid consists of data located at discrete points, the location specified by vfXCEndSubsetV might well fall between two data points. In this case, VectorField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. Get the value of the read-only resource vfXCActualEndF in order to find the exact end of the subset along the X Axis. You may set vfXCEndSubsetV using any of the data types that VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If vfXArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfXCEndSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, vfXCEndSubsetV is set to the maximum value found within the specified subset of vfXArray. Otherwise vfXCEndSubsetV is set to the same value as vfXCEndV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXCEndV Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the X Axis of the last element of the fast-varying dimension of the data.If the array resource vfXArray is NULL, you can set vfXCEndV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If vfXCStartV is greater than vfXCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the X Axis is opposite the direction of the positive X Axis. If vfXArray is NULL and vfXCEndV is not specified, VectorField sets vfXCEndV to the size of the fast-varying data dimension minus one. You may set vfXCEndV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If you set vfXArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfXCEndV. If vfXArray is one-dimensional, vfXCEndV is set to the value of its last element. If vfXArray is two-dimensional, vfXCStartV is set to the maximum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXCStartIndex This resource specifies the smaller of two indexes along the X-Axis dimension. Valid values range from 0 to one less than the value of vfXCEndIndex. It is one of four resources used to specify a rectangular subset of the data using array indexes. This is the only form of subsetting VectorField supports when vfXArray and vfYArray are set using 2D coordinate arrays, Unless vfXArray is set with a 2D array, explicitly setting vfXCStartSubsetV overrides any value set for vfXCStartIndex and causes it to be set to the largest array index value such that the requested data coordinate location is included within the subset. Otherwise, if you set vfXCStartIndex, vfXCStartSubsetV will be set based on its value. vfXCStartIndex retains its value when the data array changes, unless the X-Axis dimension size also changes. In this case, assuming neither vfXCStartSubsetV nor vfXCStartIndex is explicitly set at the same time, vfXCStartIndex is set to 0. Default: 0 
vfXCStartSubsetV vfXCStartSubsetV specifies the starting location along the X Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data. vfXCStartSubsetV should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of vfXCStartV and vfXCEndV. If vfXCStartSubsetV is outside the coordinate extent, VectorField issues a warning and sets it to the value of vfXCStartV. If the values of vfXCStartSubsetV and vfXCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by vfXCStartV and vfXCEndV, VectorField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for vfXCStartSubsetV:     at initialization or when the X-Axis dimension size changes, if vfXCStartIndex is also not set, vfXCStartSubsetV takes the value of vfXCStartV;     else if vfXCStartIndex is set, or there is a change to vfXCStartV, vfXCEndV, or vfXArray, vfXCStartSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of the vfXCStartIndex resource;     else vfXCStartSubsetV retains its current value.  Since the data grid consists of data located at discrete points, the location specified by vfXCStartSubsetV might well fall between two data points. In this case, VectorField selects a beginning index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. Get the value of the read-only resource vfXCActualStartF in order to find the exact start of the subset along the X Axis. You may set vfXCStartSubsetV using any of the data types that VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If vfXArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfXCStartSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, vfXCStartSubsetV is set to the minimum value found within the specified subset of vfXArray. Otherwise vfXCStartSubsetV is set to the same value as vfXCStartV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXCStartV Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the X Axis of the first element of the fast-varying dimension of the data. If the array resource vfXArray is NULL, you can set vfXCStartV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If vfXCStartV is greater than vfXCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the X Axis is opposite the direction of the positive X Axis. If vfXArray is NULL and vfXCStartV is not specified, VectorField sets vfXCStartV to the value 0. You may set vfXCStartV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If you set vfXArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfXCStartV. If vfXArray is one-dimensional, vfXCStartV is set to the value of its first element. If vfXArray is two-dimensional, vfXCStartV is set to the minimum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
vfXCStride When vfXCStride has a value greater than one, the VectorField object creates a new array containing only columns indexed along the X dimension by successive multiples (starting with 0) of the vfXCStride value added to the starting index. The starting index is based on the current state of the applicable subsetting resources; it is 0 if no array subsetting is in effect. The resulting array is passed to the receiving plot object. Note that if ending index minus starting index is not an exact multiple of the vfXCStride value, then the data coordinate range may be reduced slightly. The vfXCStride resource is currently ignored if vfXArray and vfYArray contain 2D coordinate arrays. Default: 1 
vfYArray If vfYArray is NULL, the coordinates of the Y (the second fastest-varying) axis of the data grid are assumed to be regularly spaced, and the endpoints are determined by the values of vfYCStartV and vfYCEndV. If vfYArray is set using a 1D array, its values represent sequential coordinate locations along the Y-Axis (the second fastest-varying dimension) of the data grid. The array must contain the same number of elements as this data array dimension. VectorField requires the coordinate array values to increase or decrease monotonically. If the coordinate array input does not have the right number of elements or is non-monotonic, VectorField issues a warning and restores vfYArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. equally-spaced along the Y Axis between the current values of vfYCStartV and vfYCEndV. If the input array is valid, VectorField replaces the current value of vfYCStartV with the value of the first element of vfYArray, and the current value of vfYCEndV with the value of the last element. If vfYArray is set using a 2D array, it must have the same dimension sizes as vfXArray and the two fastest varying dimensions of the data grid. Each element specifies the location along the Y-Axis of a single data grid cell center. For 2D coordinates, there is no requirement that the coordinates be monotonic. However, if the coordinates provided are not well-ordered as expected by the 2D-coordinate tranvformation routines, errors will occur when the Draw method is called. If the array does not contain valid dimension sizes, VectorField issues a warning restores vfYArray to its previous, possibly NULL, value. You can specify vfYArray using a one or two dimensional array of any of the types allowed for vfDataArray. V4.1 Status Note 1 Default: NULL 
vfYCActualEndF When an ending location for a subset of the data is specified using vfYCEndSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. In this case, VectorField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. The read-only resource vfYCActualEndF is set to the value of the actual ending location of the data subset along the Y Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, vfYCActualEndF has the same value as vfYCEndSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfYCActualStartF When a starting location for a subset of the data is specified using vfYCStartSubsetV, this location might well fall between two data points. In this case, VectorField selects a beginning index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. The read-only resource vfYCActualStartF is set to the value of the actual starting location of the data subset along the Y Axis. When subsets are not specified, or are specified using the array indexing resources, vfYCActualStartF has the same value as vfYCStartSubsetV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfYCEndIndex This resource specifies the larger of two indexes along the Y-Axis data dimension. Valid values range from one greater than the value of vfYCStartIndex to one less than the size of the dimension. It is one of four resources used to specify a rectangular subset of the data using array indexes. This is the only form of subsetting VectorField supports when vfXArray and vfYArray are set using 2D coordinate arrays, Unless vfYArray is set with a 2D array, explicitly setting vfYCEndSubsetV overrides any value set for vfYCEndIndex and causes it to be set to the smallest array index value such that the requested data coordinate location is included within the subset. Otherwise, if you set vfYCEndIndex, vfYCEndSubsetV will be set based on its value. vfYCEndIndex retains its value when the data array changes, unless the Y-Axis dimension size also changes. In this case, assuming neither vfYCEndSubsetV nor vfYCEndIndex is explicitly set at the same time, vfYCEndIndex is set to the size of the Y-Axis dimension minus one. Default: <dynamic> 
vfYCEndSubsetV vfYCEndSubsetV specifies the ending location along the Y Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data. It should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of vfYCStartV and vfYCEndV. If it is outside the coordinate extent, VectorField issues a warning and sets it to the value of vfYCEndV. If the values of vfYCStartSubsetV and vfYCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by vfYCStartV and vfYCEndV, VectorField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for vfYCEndSubsetV:     at initialization or when the Y-Axis dimension size changes, if vfYCEndIndex is not set, vfYCEndSubsetV takes the value of vfYCEndV;     else if vfYCEndIndex is set, or there is a change to vfYCStartV, vfYCEndV, or vfYArray, vfYCEndSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of vfYCEndIndex;     else vfYCEndSubsetV retains its current value.  Since the data grid consists of data located at discrete points, the location specified by vfYCEndSubsetV might well fall between two data points. In this case, VectorField selects an ending index for the array subset such that the requested location is included within the subset. Thus the subset array, as delivered to the receiving object, may represent a slightly larger area of the data coordinate space than requested. Get the value of the read-only resource vfYCActualEndF in order to find the exact end of the subset along the Y Axis. You may set vfYCEndSubsetV using any of the data types that VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If vfYArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfYCEndSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, vfYCEndSubsetV is set to the maximum value found within the specified subset of vfYArray. Otherwise vfYCEndSubsetV is set to the same value as vfYCEndV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfYCEndV Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the Y Axis of the last element along the slower-varying dimension of the data. If the array resource vfYArray is set and found to be valid, VectorField overwrites the current value of vfYCStartV, replacing it with the value of the last element of vfYArray. Otherwise, you can set vfYCStartV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If vfYCStartV is greater than vfYCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the Y Axis is opposite the direction of the positive Y Axis. If vfYArray is NULL or invalid and vfYCEndV is not specified, VectorField sets vfYCEndV to the size of the slower-varying data dimension minus one. You may set vfYCEndV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If you set vfXArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfXCEndV. If vfXArray is one-dimensional, vfXCEndV is set to the value of its last element. If vfXArray is two-dimensional, vfXCStartV is set to the maximum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
vfYCStartIndex This resource specifies the smaller of two indexes along the Y-Axis dimension. Valid values range from 0 to one less than the value of vfYCEndIndex.

In this case, assuming neither vfYCStartSubsetV nor vfYCStartIndex is explicitly set at the same time, vfYCStartIndex is set to 0. Default: 0 
vfYCStartSubsetV vfYCStartSubsetV specifies the starting location along the Y Axis of a rectangular sub-array of the data. It should be set to a value within the data coordinate extent as established by the values of vfYCStartV and vfYCEndV. If it is outside the coordinate extent, VectorField issues a warning and sets it to the value of vfYCStartV. If the values of vfYCStartSubsetV and vfYCEndSubsetV are oppositely directed from the direction established by vfYCStartV and vfYCEndV, VectorField issues a warning and exchanges their values. When you do not explicitly set a value for vfYCStartSubsetV:     at initialization or when the Y-Axis dimension size changes, if vfYCStartIndex is not set, vfYCStartSubsetV takes the value of vfYCStartV;     else if vfYCStartIndex is set, or there is a change to vfYCStartV, vfYCEndV, or vfYArray, vfYCStartSubsetV takes the data coordinate value indexed by the value of vfYCStartIndex;     else vfYCStartSubsetV retains its current value.

Get the value of the read-only resource vfYCActualStartF in order to find the exact start of the subset along the Y Axis. You may set vfYCStartSubsetV using any of the data types that VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If vfYArray is set with a valid 2D coordinate array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfYCStartSubsetV. If a subset has been set using the indexing resources, vfYCStartSubsetV is set to the mimimum value found within the specified subset of vfYArray. Otherwise vfYCStartSubsetV is set to the same value as vfYCStartV. Default: <dynamic> 
vfYCStartV Ordinarily, this resource specifies the location along the Y Axis of the first element of the slow-varying dimension of the data. If the array resource vfYArray is NULL, you can set vfYCStartV to any value (presumably meaningful in the context of the your data). If vfYCStartV is greater than vfYCEndV, the direction of the data locations along the Y Axis is opposite the direction of the positive Y Axis. If vfYArray is NULL and vfYCStartV is not specified, VectorField sets vfYCStartV to the value 0. You may set vfYCStartV using any of the data types VectorField accepts for the vfDataArray resource. If you set vfYArray with a valid 1D or 2D array, VectorField ignores any value set for vfYCStartV. If vfYArray is one-dimensional, vfYCStartV is set to the value of its first element. If vfYArray is two-dimensional, vfYCStartV is set to the minimum value found in all elements of the array. In this case, it could correspond to any element of the data array. Default: <dynamic> 
vfYCStride When vfYCStride has a value greater than one, the VectorField object creates a new array containing only rows indexed along the Y dimension by successive multiples (starting with 0) of the vfYCStride value added to the starting index. The starting index is based on the current state of the applicable subsetting resources; it is 0 if no array subsetting in effect. The resulting array is passed to the receiving plot object. Note that if ending index minus starting index is not an exact multiple of the vfYCStride value, then the data coordinate range may be reduced slightly. The vfYCStride resource is currently ignored if vfXArray and vfYArray contain 2D coordinate arrays. Default: 1 
vpAnnoManagerId If the View object is currently functioning as an external annotation of a Plot Object, this read-only resource contains the id of the AnnoManager object used to manage the View object's location and size. If the View object is not currently an annotation, the value of the resource is set to NullObjId (0). Default: False 
vpClipOn When this boolean resource is set True, all content elements of a plot object are clipped at the viewport boundaries. Setting it False allows plot elements that are not internally constrained to fall with the viewport to appear outside the viewport boundaries. Currently only VectorPlot objects allow any plot elements to appear outside the viewport. Note this resource does not apply to plot annotations such as tick marks and titles. Default: True 
vpHeightF vpHeightF specifies the height of View object's bounding box in NDC units. Default: 0.6 
vpKeepAspect While the boolean resource vpKeepAspect is True, the View object keeps its initial shape (aspect ratio); however you may modify its size resources. If you modify either or both the size resources, vpWidthF and vpHeightF, View will constrain its new bounding box to the largest box with an aspect ratio matching the original shape that can be inscribed within a box of the specified size. When vpKeepAspect is False, View places no constraints on the shape of its bounding box when you modify the size resources. Default: False 
vpOn Set vpOn False to disable the Draw method of a View object. When its Draw method is disabled, the view, its View class children, its overlays, and its added annotations do not appear on the workstation when a Draw is executed. Default: True 
vpUseSegments When the boolean resource vpUseSegments is set True for a View class object, the object will, if it is able, create a segment and draw into it while it draws to the designated Workstation object. The segment is stored as a file, and contains the low-level commands required to re-create the object, possibly with transformations to the position, size, or shape applied. When you next draw the object, assuming none of the object's resources other than vpXF, vpYF, vpWidthF, or vpHeightF have been modified, it will recreate its image based on information stored in the segment. Using segments can substantially shorten the time required to perform a draw when the plot contains elements, such as filled maps, that require considerable computation to generate initially. Note that because the transformations differ slightly, a segment drawn at a different size from the size at which it was created may not match in every detail the plot resulting from a new draw of the object at that size. Default: False 
vpWidthF vpWidthF specifies the width of View object's bounding box in NDC units. Default: 0.6 
vpXF vpXF specifies the location of left edge of the View object's bounding box in NDC space. Default: 0.2 
vpYF vpYF specifies the location of top edge of the View object's bounding box in NDC space. Default: 0.8 
wkAntiAlias (Workstation) Used to control whether the Workstation employs anti-aliasing algorithms in the generation of graphical output. (Anti-aliasing refers to a number of techniques for softening the appearance of graphical artifacts such as jagged edges/lines.) There are three possible settings: On     Anti-aliasing measures are applied to all graphical output.  Off     No anti-aliasing algorithms are used.  TextOnly     Anti-aliasing is applied to only the generation of textual graphics.  NOTE: This resource is not applicable to the PSWorkstation or PDFWorkstation types. Default: On 
wkBackgroundColor (Workstation) This resource can be a one-dimensional array containing three elements of type NhlTFloat that specify (in order) the red, green, and blue components (an RGB triplet) of the Workstation background color, or a string containing a color name from the file $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/database/rgb.txt. You may set wkBackgroundColor only when the Workstation object is created. The background color is accessed for drawing purposes using HLU color index 0 (or the defined constant NhlBACKGROUND when using the C language interface). If defining this resource with an RGB triplet, each element must be in the range 0.0 through 1.0 inclusive. If any element is invalid, the Workstation object issues a warning, and reverts to the default background color value. Default: (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) (Black) 
wkBackgroundOpacityF (Workstation) Sets the opacity of the background color. This should be a value between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque). NOTE: This resource is not applicable to the PSWorkstation or PDFWorkstation types. Default: 1.0 
wkColorMapLen (Workstation) This read-only resource allows you to determine the number of elements currently in the wkColorMap without retrieving the whole table. This is one more than the largest currently defined index. Default: <dynamic> 
wkColorMap (Workstation) Use this resource to set or retrieve the colormap for a Workstation object. To set this resource, use a two-dimensional array of type NhlTFloat, an array of color specification formats, or a pre-defined colormap name. If you retrieve this resource, it will be a two-dimensional array of type NhlTFloat. For a two-dimensional array, the fastest varying dimension contains three elements that define (in order) the red, green, and blue components of a single color. Each component should be within the range 0.0 through 1.0 inclusive. If the red component of a color is specified with a negative number, then the color is considered to be a missing value, and that index of the colormap will default. In all other cases, an error message will be generated if values are outside the range of 0.0 through 1.0 inclusive. For an array of color specification formats, each element must be enclosed in double quotes and be either an RGB triplet as described above, or a named color from the $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/database/rgb.txt file. For a pre-defined colormap name, set the resource to one of over 40 pre-defined colormap names found in the color table gallery. If you do not set wkColorMap, the Workstation object will use a default color map. The first triple of the wkColorMap array (index 1 of the slow-varying dimension using the Fortran interface, or index 0 using the C interface) is the background color for the Workstation and is accessed as HLU color index 0. In the default colormap, the color is dynamically determined based on the Workstation subclass. For example, the background color for the XWorkstation is black, but the background color for the PSWorkstation and PDFWorkstation is white. The background color can also be set using the wkBackgroundColor resource as a convenience. The second triple of the wkColorMap array (index 2 of the slow-varying dimension using the Fortran interface, or index 1 using the C interface) is the foreground color for the Workstation and is accessed as HLU color index 1. The foreground color is also dynamically determined. It defaults to either white or black, whichever is determined to contrast more with the background color. Default: "default" 
wkColorModel (PDFWorkstation) Note: applies only to the original PDF driver, referred to as "oldpdf" in gsn_open_wks. This resource specifies the color model used to describe colors in the output PDF file. The choices are "rgb" for the Red-Green-Blue color model or "cmyk" for the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black color model. Note that this resource affects the output file only. Elements of the wkColorMap array be set using the RGB model or named colors only. Default: "rgb" 
wkColorModel (PSWorkstation) Note: applies only to the original postscript driver, referred to as "oldps" in gsn_open_wks. This resource specifies the color model used to describe colors in the output PostScript file. The choices are "rgb" for the Red-Green-Blue color model or "cmyk" for the Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black color model. Note that this resource affects the output file only. Elements of the wkColorMap array be set using the RGB model or named colors only. Default: "rgb" 
wkDashTableLength (Workstation) This read-only resource contains the number of currently available unique dash patterns. Default: <dynamic> 
wkDefGraphicStyleId (Workstation) This read-only resource contains the default GraphicStyle object that is created along with the Workstation itself. If you call an immediate mode graphics primitive function without specifying an explicit GraphicStyle object, the Workstation uses the default GraphicStyle object to determine the attributes used to render the graphics primitive. You may modify these attributes by retrieving the default GraphicStyle object, and then setting its resources as desired. Default: <dynamic> 
wkDeviceLowerX (DocumentWorkstation) Defines the Lower X value of the normalized device coordinate viewport on the page. It is specified in PostScript coordinate space where one unit corresponds to 1/72 of an inch. 0 addresses the left side of an 8.5" x 11" page, and 612 addresses the right side. For details on using the PostScript workstation positioning resources, see the appropriate section in the NCAR GKS User's Guide for NCAR GKS-0A Graphics. It is particularly important to consult the section in the GKS manual on using the full page if you are using the PostScript workstation positioning resources with a PostScript landscape workstation.

It is specified in PostScript coordinate space where one unit corresponds to 1/72 of an inch. 0 addresses the left side of an 8.5" x 11" page, and 612 addresses the right side. Default: calculated as paper_width - 36, see wkPaperSize 
wkDeviceUpperY (DocumentWorkstation) Defines the Upper Y value of the normalized device coordinate viewport on the page. It is specified in PostScript coordinate space where one unit corresponds to 1/72 of an inch. 0 addresses the bottom side of an 8.5" x 11" page, and 792 addresses the top side. Default: calculated as paper_height - 126, see wkPaperSize 
wkDeviceUpperY (PDFWorkstation) Defines the Upper Y value of the normalized device coordinate viewport on the page. It is specified in PDF coordinate space where one unit corresponds to 1/72 of an inch. 0 addresses the bottom side of an 8.5" x 11" page, and 792 addresses the top side. Default: calculated as paper_height - 126, see wkPaperSize

It is specified in PostScript coordinate space where one unit corresponds to 1/72 of an inch. 0 addresses the bottom side of an 8.5" x 11" page, and 792 addresses the top side. Default: calculated as paper_height - 126, see wkPaperSize 
wkFileName (DocumentWorkstation) This resource specifies the name of the output file. Default: <dynamic> 
wkFileName (ImageWorkstation) This resource specifies the name of the output file. Default: <dynamic> 
wkFillTableLength (Workstation) This read-only resource contains the number of currently available unique fill patterns. Default: <dynamic> 
wkForegroundColor (Workstation) This resource can be a one-dimensional array containing three elements of type NhlTFloat that specify (in order) the red, green, and blue components (an RGB triplet) of the Workstation foreground color, or a string containing a color name from the file $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/database/rgb.txt. The foreground color is equivalent to HLU color index 1 (the defined constant NhlFOREGROUND when using the C language interface). It is the first element of the wkColorMap array (index 0 of the array when using the C interface). Unlike wkBackgroundColor, you may set wkForegroundColor at any time during the life of the Workstation object. If you set wkForegroundColor and wkColorMap at the same time, the set value of the first element of wkColorMap will be replaced with the value of wkForegroundColor. If neither wkForegroundColor nor wkColorMap is set when the Workstation object is created, the foreground is determined dynamically. Default: <dynamic> If background color is determined to be closer to black than white, the foreground color is set to white (1.0, 1.0, 1.0); otherwise the foreground color is set to black (0.0, 0.0, 0.0). 
wkFormat (DocumentWorkstation) This resource is used to specify which output format should be produced; use "ps" for postscript output, "pdf" for PDF output, "eps" for encapsulated-postscript, or "svg" for scalable vector graphics format. Default: "ps" 
wkFormat (ImageWorkstation) This resource is used to specify which output format should be produced. Currently, only PNG is supported, specified as "png". Default: "png" 
wkFullBackground (PDFWorkstation) If this resource is True, then the entire output page will have the background color applied to it. If it is False, then only the normalized device coordinate viewport will be effected by the background color. The background is the first thing drawn on the page. Therefore, if this resource is modified after something has been drawn, it will not change the background for the current page. It will effectively change for the next page of the output. Default: False 
wkFullBackground (PSWorkstation) If this resource is True, then the entire output page will have the background color applied to it. If it is False, then only the normalized device coordinate viewport will be effected by the background color. The background is the first thing drawn on the page. Therefore, if this resource is modified after something has been drawn, it will not change the background for the current page. It will effectively change for the next page of the output. Default: False 
wkGksWorkId (Workstation) This read-only resource contains the low-level GKS workstation identifier. It can be used to mix calls to the low-level NCAR Graphics library and the GKS library with the HLU library. The HLU library expects the GKS workstation to be in a deactivated state. Therefore, any set of low-level calls occurring between HLU library calls should be bracketed by a GKS activate workstation call and a GKS deactivate workstation call. Default: <dynamic> This value is determined by the low-level GKS library. 
wkHeight (ImageWorkstation) This resource specifies the height, in pixels, of the resultant image. Default: 1024 
wkMarkerTableLength (Workstation) This read-only resource contains the number of currently available unique markers. Default: <dynamic> 
wkMetaName (NcgmWorkstation) Specifies the name and path of the output metafile. By default a file called gmeta will be created in the current working directory. The NcgmWorkstation object will attempt to resolve pathnames that start with the "~" character. Default: "gmeta" 
wkOrientation (DocumentWorkstation) This resource is used to indicate if the PS or PDF output should be produced in "portrait" mode (pictures displayed along the width of the paper or viewing window) or "landscape" mode (pictures displayed along the length). Default: "portrait" 
wkOrientation (PDFWorkstation) This resource is used to indicate if the PDF output should be produced in "portrait" mode (pictures displayed along the width of the paper or viewing window) or "landscape" mode (pictures displayed along the length). Default: "portrait" 
wkOrientation (PSWorkstation) This resource is used to indicate if the PostScript output should be produced in "portrait" mode (pictures displayed along the width of the paper or viewing window) or "landscape" mode (pictures displayed along the length). Default: "portrait" 
wkPDFFileName (PDFWorkstation) This resource is used to specify the name of the PDF file to output. If a wkPDFFileName of "stdout" is given, the PDFWorkstation understands the output should be sent to the stream associated with the stdout FILE pointer in the UNIX environment. The PDFWorkstation object will attempt to resolve pathnames that start with the "~" character. Default: <dynamic> This resource defaults to the name of the PDFWorkstation object with the wkPDFFormat as a suffix. For example, "workname.pdf". 
wkPDFFormat (PDFWorkstation) This resource is used to specify which Portable Document Format (PDF) should be produced. Currently, the PDFWorkstation can produce only "pdf" formatted documents. Default: "pdf" 
wkPDFResolution (PDFWorkstation) This resource indicates the resolution of the internal coordinate space of the PDF file. This resource is used to increase or decrease the resolution of the output. The effective resolution you get on a particular PDF printer or screen display depends on the resolution of the internal PDF coordinate system as well as the resolution of the output device. The units of this resource are compatible with DPI (Dots Per Inch). If wkPDFResolution is set to a number that is greater than or equal to the resolution of the printer, then you can be sure that you are making full use of the resolution of the printer. It is important to realize that printers that have a lower resolution can print PDF files that have a higher internal coordinate space resolution without problems, since the internal coordinate space resolution just indicates the resolution of the points within the file's coordinate space. If the PDF output is generated with a lower internal coordinate space resolution then the printer, the full resolution of the printer will not be utilized. Changing the value for wkPDFResolution will usually not change the size of the PDF output file; if it does, the files will differ by only a few bytes. Default: 1800 
wkPSFileName (PSWorkstation) This resource is used to specify the name of the PostScript file to output. If a wkPSFileName of "stdout" is given, the PSWorkstation understands the output should be sent to the stream associated with the stdout FILE pointer in the UNIX environment. The PSWorkstation object will attempt to resolve pathnames that start with the "~" character. Default: <dynamic> This resource defaults to the name of the PSWorkstation object with the wkPSFormat as a suffix. For example, "workname.ps". 
wkPSFormat (PSWorkstation) This resource is used to specify which PostScript format should be produced. Currently, the PSWorkstation can produce generic "ps", EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) "eps", and EPSI (Encapsulated PostScript Interchange format) "epsi". EPS is a specialized format used primarily for importing PostScript into other applications. EPS files contain information in them, that allow an importing application to know the extent of the marks on the PostScript page. They are also restricted to a single page of output in them. EPSI are EPS files that have a "preview bitmap" that represents the PostScript image contained in the file. This bitmap can be used by an importing application to display quickly a picture of the imported file. This is used by applications that do not have a built-in PostScript interpreter. As of Version 4.0, the "preview bitmap" output by the PSWorkstation does not represent the picture contained in the EPSI file, but rather is simply a bitmap containing the message: APPLICATION CANNOT DISPLAY NCAR GRAPHIC HERE. VIEW THE POSTSCRIPT OUTPUT TO VERIFY SUCCESSFUL IMPORT. Default: "ps" 
wkPSResolution (PSWorkstation) This resource indicates the resolution of the internal coordinate space of the PostScript file. This resource is used to increase or decrease the resolution of the output. The effective resolution you get on a particular PostScript printer or screen display depends on the resolution of the internal PostScript coordinate system as well as the resolution of the output device. The units of this resource are compatible with DPI (Dots Per Inch). If wkPSResolution is set to a number that is greater than or equal to the resolution of the printer, then you can be sure that you are making full use of the resolution of the printer. It is important to realize that printers that have a lower resolution can print PostScript files that have a higher internal coordinate space resolution without problems, since the internal coordinate space resolution just indicates the resolution of the points within the file's coordinate space. If the PostScript is generated with a lower internal coordinate space resolution then the printer, the full resolution of the printer will not be utilized. One advantage of lowering the wkPSResolution would be to make the actual size of the PostScript file smaller, although the difference is rather modest. Default: 1800 
wkPaperHeightF (DocumentWorkstation) This resource can be used to specify the height of the paper, in inches. Must be used in conjunction with wkPaperWidthF. If these two resources are used along with wkPaperSize, the value for wkPaperSize will prevail. Default: 11 inches 
wkPaperHeightF (PDFWorkstation) This resource can be used to specify the height of the paper, in inches. Must be used in conjunction with wkPaperWidthF. If these two resources are used along with wkPaperSize, the value for wkPaperSize will prevail. Default: 11 inches 
wkPaperHeightF (PSWorkstation) This resource can be used to specify the height of the paper, in inches. Must be used in conjunction with wkPaperWidthF. If these two resources are used along with wkPaperSize, the value for wkPaperSize will prevail. Default: 11 inches 
wkPaperSize (DocumentWorkstation) This resource can be used to specify a standard paper size by name. Currently recognized names are:                     ANSI/U.S. paper sizes         name        points     inches    millimeters         "A"        612  792   8.5  11.0   216  279         "letter"   612  792   8.5  11.0   216  279         "legal"    612 1008   8.5  14.0   216  356         "B"        792 1224  11.0  17.0   279  432         "ledger"   792 1224  11.0  17.0   279  432         "superA3"  936 1368  13.0  19.0   330  483         "superB"   936 1368  13.0  19.0   330  483         "C"       1224 1584  17.0  22.0   432  559         "D"       1584 2520  22.0  34.0   559  864         "E"       2448 3168  34.0  44.0   864 1118                             ISO/Metric paper sizes          "A5"       418  598   5.8   8.3   148  210         "A4"       598  842   8.3  11.7   210  297         "A3"       842 1188  11.7  16.5   297  420         "A3+"      936 1368  13.0  19.0   329  483         "A2"      1188 1685  16.5  23.4   420  594         "A1"      1685 2383  23.4  33.1   594  841         "A0"      2383 3370  33.1  46.8   841 1189 Default: "letter"

wkPaperWidthF (DocumentWorkstation) This resource can be used to specify the width of the paper, in inches. Must be used in conjunction with wkPaperHeightF. If these two resources are used along with wkPaperSize, the value for wkPaperSize will prevail. Default: 8.5 inches 
wkPaperWidthF (PDFWorkstation) This resource can be used to specify the width of the paper, in inches. Must be used in conjunction with wkPaperHeightF. If these two resources are used along with wkPaperSize, the value for wkPaperSize will prevail. Default: 8.5 inches 
wkPaperWidthF (PSWorkstation) This resource can be used to specify the width of the paper, in inches. Must be used in conjunction with wkPaperHeightF. If these two resources are used along with wkPaperSize, the value for wkPaperSize will prevail. Default: 8.5 inches 
wkTopLevelViews (Workstation) This read-only array resource contains the ids of only those View children of the Workstation that may be drawn directly. This list excludes all View objects that are currently plot members. Default: <dynamic> 
wkViews (Workstation) This read-only array resource contains the ids of all View object children of the Workstation. This list includes View objects that are plot members. Default: <dynamic> 
wkVisualType (PDFWorkstation) This resource is used to indicate if the PDF file should produce "color", or "monochrome" output. Color output can be displayed on a grayscale printer, and the colors will be mapped to shades of gray. If "monochrome" output is selected, all colors, except the background color, will be mapped to the foreground color. If you are plotting a color image on a grayscale printer and find the results unsatisfactory since colors are getting mapped to light shades of gray that are difficult to see, it may be better to produce the picture in "monochrome". Default: "color" 
wkVisualType (PSWorkstation) This resource is used to indicate if the PostScript file should produce "color", or "monochrome" output. Color output can be displayed on a grayscale printer, and the colors will be mapped to shades of gray. If "monochrome" output is selected, all colors, except the background color, will be mapped to the foreground color. If you are plotting a color image on a grayscale printer and find the results unsatisfactory since colors are getting mapped to light shades of gray that are difficult to see, it may be better to produce the picture in "monochrome". Default: "color" 
wkWidth (ImageWorkstation) This resource specifies the width, in pixels, of the resultant image. Default: 1024 
wsCurrentSize You can determine the total size currently allocated for all workspaces managed by the Workspace object at any point in an HLU program by retrieving the value of the read-only resource wsCurrentSize. To do this, you must first get the id of the Workspace object using the NhlGetWorkspaceObjectId function. Default: 0 
wsMaximumSize This resource specifies the total size in bytes that is allowed to be allocated at any single time for all workspaces managed by the Workspace object during the execution of an HLU program. If the Workspace object is asked to allocate or reallocate a workspace such that this value would be exceeded, the Workspace refuses to attempt the allocation and returns a fatal error. In order to modify wsMaximumSize you must first get the id of the Workspace object using the NhlGetWorkspaceObjectId function. Alternatively, in order to permanently change the size you can put a line such as *wsMaximumSize : 300000000 into your .hluresfile. Note that when very large amounts of workspace are required, usually the processing time also increases greatly. Sometimes errors indicating that the workspace is exhausted actually are a symptom of another problem with the code. Default: 100000000 
wsThresholdSize Whenever the sum of the size in bytes of all currently allocated workspaces exceeds the value of the resource wsThresholdSize, the Workspace object attempts to reduce the total allocation below the threshold size by freeing workspaces that are not currently in use. If it is necessary to keep the data in a workspace, the contents of the workspace will first be written to a file. The total size allocated to workspaces may exceed wsThresholdSize if the total size of workspaces currently in use exceeds the threshold size. In order to modify wsThresholdSize you must first get the id of the Workspace object using the NhlGetWorkspaceObjectId function. Default: 4194304 
xyComputeXMax If this resource is True, then the trXMaxF resource will be recalculated every time the xyCoordData resource is modified. If this resource is False, then the trXMaxF resource will not be recalculated each time the xyCoordData resource is modified. Default: <dynamic> If the programmer specifies the trXMaxF resource, then the default for this resource will be False. If the programmer doesn't specify the trXMaxF resource, then the default for this resource will be True. 
xyComputeXMin If this resource is True, then the trXMinF resource will be recalculated every time the xyCoordData resource is modified. If this resource is False, then the trXMinF resource will not be recalculated each time the xyCoordData resource is modified. Default: <dynamic> If the programmer specifies the trXMinF resource, then the default for this resource will be False. If the programmer doesn't specify the trXMinF resource, then the default for this resource will be True. 
xyComputeYMax If this resource is True, then the trYMaxF resource will be recalculated every time the xyCoordData resource is modified. If this resource is False, then the trYMaxF resource will not be recalculated each time the xyCoordData resource is modified. Default: <dynamic> If the programmer specifies the trYMaxF resource, then the default for this resource will be False. If the programmer doesn't specify the trYMaxF resource, then the default for this resource will be True. 
xyComputeYMin If this resource is True, then the trYMinF resource will be recalculated every time the xyCoordData resource is modified. If this resource is False, then the trYMinF resource will not be recalculated each time the xyCoordData resource is modified. Default: <dynamic> If the programmer specifies the trYMinF resource, then the default for this resource will be False. If the programmer doesn't specify the trYMinF resource, then the default for this resource will be True. 
xyCoordData Specifies the array of data object ids that provide the X/Y coordinate pairs to be plotted. This resource is a data resource partially managed with the help of the DataComm superclass. Default: NULL 
xyCoordDataSpec This resource is a retrievable resource only. It is used to allow the user a greater amount of configurability for how each coordinate pair array is displayed in the XyPlot. After adding DataItems to the XyPlot xyCoordData resource, this resource can be retrieved to get an array of XyDataSpec object ids. This array is ordered so that the elements of this array correspond directly with the elements of the xyCoordData array resource. The XyDataSpec resources can be set to each object in this array. This will determine exactly how the corresponding DataItem in the xyCoordData resource will be rendered in the XyPlot. Default: NULL 
xyCurveDrawOrder This resource of type NhlTDrawOrder determines when the curves representing X/Y coordinate data are drawn relative to other elements of the plot. Ordinarily, you only need to adjust the draw order of the curves when an XyPlot is combined with other plots in an overlay sequence. There are three choices: PreDraw     Draw the XyPlot curves before the standard draw; the lines will be overlaid by any subsequently drawn elements.  Draw     Draw the curves during the standard draw; the lines will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw phase, but will underlie elements drawn during the postdraw phase.  PostDraw     Draw the curves after the standard draw; the lines will overlay any elements drawn during the predraw and draw phases.  Default: Draw 
xyDashPattern This resource determines the dash pattern index that all the curves derived from the associated data object will be drawn with if xyMonoDashPattern is True. Default: SolidLine 
xyDashPatterns An array of integer dash pattern indexes to use when drawing the corresponding curves in the associated data object. If there are more curves than the number of dash pattern indexes in this resource, the remaining curves will be drawn using the xyDashPattern resource. This resource is only used if the xyMonoDashPattern resource is False. Default: NULL 
xyExplicitLabels An array of character strings to place inside the corresponding curve in the associated DataItem. If there are more curves than the number of strings in this resource, the remaining curves will be labeled by using the name of the XyDataSpec object and appending the curve index. Default: NULL 
xyExplicitLegendLabels An array of character strings to use as labels in the XyPlot legend. The legend labels will default to the values in the xyExplicitLabels resource. If there are more coordinate pair arrays than the number of elements in this resource, the remaining coordinate pair arrays will also be labeled with the corresponding value of the xyExplicitLabels resource. Default: NULL 
xyLabelMode This can be set to either NoLabels, Lettered, or Custom. NoLabels means that the curves from the associated DataItem will not be labeled. Lettered means that the curves will be labeled with capital letters in the order in which they appear in the associated DataItem. The current letter is retained so that if the next XyDataSpec in the list is using Lettered, the letter will not be reused until the entire alphabet has been used. (Note: This means that Lettered curves do not necessarily retain the same label when data are added or removed from the xyCoordData resource. Custom means that the curves will be labeled with the corresponding strings provided by the xyExplicitLabels resource. If there is no corresponding string, the curves will be labeled by using the name of the XyDataSpec object and appending the curve index. Default: NoLabels 
xyLineColor This resource determines what color all the curves derived from the associated data object will be drawn with if xyMonoLineColor is True. You can use a color index value (integer) or a named color (string). Default: Default: Foreground (1) 
xyLineColors An array of colors to use when drawing the corresponding curves in the associated data object. If there are more curves than the number of colors given in this resource, the remaining curves will be drawn using the xyLineColor resource. You can use an array of color indices (integers) or named colors (strings). This resource is only used if the xyMonoLineColor resource is False. Default: NULL 
xyLineDashSegLenF This resource indicates the length of each segment of a dash pattern. It is the length in NDCs before the dash pattern repeats itself. This resource automatically scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the XyPlot. If line labels are being drawn, this is also the length between the end of one label and the start of the next. Default: <dynamic> This resource defaults to 25 percent of the average of the XyPlot's width and height. 
xyLineLabelConstantSpacingF Normally when xyLineLabelFontQuality is set to High, the XyPlot object writes line label text with proportional spacing. Setting the xyLineLabelConstantSpacingF to a value greater than 0.0 overrides this behavior. Instead, the distance from the start of one character to the next is computed by multiplying a single standard character width by the value of xyLineLabelConstantSpacingF. When xyLineLabelConstantSpacingF has a value between 0.0 and 1.0, characters will overlap. A value of 1.0 implies, on average, no space between characters, while values increasing from 1.0 cause the space between characters to grow. This parameter is ignored when xyLineLabelFontQuality is not High. Values less than 0.0 result in an error and are replaced with the default value. Note that there is only a scalar version of this resource. If the XyPlot object references more than one DataItem object, the XyDataSpec object referenced by the first element of the xyCoordDataSpec array will provide the resource value for all line labels. Default: 0.0 
xyLineLabelFont This resource of type NhlTFont specifies the font used to render line labels. Note that there is only a scalar version of this resource. If the XyPlot object references more than one DataItem object, the XyDataSpec object referenced by the first element of the xyCoordDataSpec array will provide the resource value for all line labels. Default: "pwritx" 
xyLineLabelFontAspectF This resource determines the shape of the line label characters. Values increasing from 1.0 result in thinner characters. Values decreasing from 1.0 make the characters wider. Values less than or equal to 0.0 result in a WARNING message and a restoration of the default value. Note that there is only a scalar version of this resource. If the XyPlot object references more than one DataItem object, the XyDataSpec object referenced by the first element of the xyCoordDataSpec array will provide the resource value for all line labels. Default: 1.3125 
xyLineLabelFontColor This resource indicates what color to draw the line labels if xyLabelMode is set to Lettered or Custom. This value is only used if xyMonoLineLabelFontColor is True, or the xyLineLabelFontColors array doesn't specify enough values. You can use a color index value w(integer) or a named color (string). Default: Foreground (1) 
xyLineLabelFontColors This resource indicates what color index to draw the line labels in if xyLabelMode is set to Lettered or Custom.

xyLineLabelFontHeightF This allows the user to set the size of the characters used for the curve labels when the data-dependent resource xyLabelMode is set to LETTERED or CUSTOM. The size of the font is expressed in NDCs and scales with changes in the size of the viewport of the XyPlot object. Default: <dynamic> This resource defaults to 1.5 percent of the average of the XyPlot's width and height. 
xyLineLabelFontQuality This resource of type NhlTFontQuality determines the quality of the font used to draw XyPlot line labels. Note that there is only a scalar version of this resource.

Default: High 
xyLineLabelFontThicknessF Sets the thickness of the line used to draw line label text. The value acts as a multiplier of a (device-dependent) unit thickness. This resource is ignored when the xyLineLabelFont specifies a filled font (font indexes 21-22, 25-26, 29-30, and 33-37). Note that there is only a scalar version of this resource. If the XyPlot object references more than one DataItem object, the XyDataSpec object referenced by the first element of the xyCoordDataSpec array will provide the resource value for all line labels. Default: 1.0 
xyLineLabelFuncCode This resource of type NhlTCharacter sets the function code character that the low level utilities will use when parsing the label string. Note that there is only a scalar version of this resource. If the XyPlot object references more than one DataItem object, the XyDataSpec object referenced by the first element of the xyCoordDataSpec array will provide the resource value for all line labels. Note: the default function code was a colon (:) in NCL Versions 6.0.0 and earlier. Default: ~
