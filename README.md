ncl_lazy_vim README
===================

If you are using vi/vim/gvim for scripting with NCL, you can sometimes hardly remember NCL commands or you are just too lazy to type out "gsFillWTF..." all the time, this might be something for you.

Configuration instructions
--------------------------
1. Download the two .txt files "NCL_functions.txt" and "NCL_resources.txt" from the ".vim" folder in this repository into your ".vim" folder
2. Add the lines of "add_ncl_complete_to_your_vimrc" to your "~/.vimrc" to include the complete function <br>
```
cat add_ncl_complete_to_your_vimrc >> ~/.vimrc
```
If you don't have a .vimrc file yet, you may also just my working example "example.vimrc" and rename it in your $HOME <br>

Optional: <br>
1. Variable completion: Set a file path and 'ENABLE' vars_completion in your ".vimrc" <br> - requires CDO - if you have a neat idea how to implement it with NCL commands please approach me
![animation]( vars_completion.gif ) <br>
2. For now, the first 12 (random number) words of NCL Resources are displayed in the pop-up window before the last two words as "Default information" separated by "...". If you usually work on a wide vi window, you can modify this number of strings. <br>
3. If you fancy other auto-completion setting, play with the line
```
set complete=longest,menuone
```
The current setting completes up to the last common string and then shows a menu. Other options are listed in the vim help or http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'completeopt' <br>

<br>

Syntax highlighting:
* coming soon dynamical hopefully <br> for now data from Version 6.4.0 - https://www.ncl.ucar.edu 

Snippets: 
* copy "ncl.snippets" into "/.vim/bundle/vim-snippets/snippets" after you installed the vim plugin snipmate https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate <br>
![animation]( snippets_ncl.gif ) <br>
There are also a few snippets for loops and some combined graphic commands in the end of the file, just check it out. Type the snippet (any command from "ncl.snippets", basically all commands that require brackets) and press &lt;Tab>

Operating instructions
----------------------
Start typing your desired cdo command and hit &lt;Ctrl-X>&lt;Ctrl-U>
```
res@gsF<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
addf<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-U>
```
Get the following autocompletion options 
```
gsFillBackgroundColor   NCL Res: This resource of type ... Default: Transparent
gsFillColor             NCL Res: This resource of type ... Default: Foreground
or
